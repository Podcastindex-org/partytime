      <title>1048-Healing the Wounded Inner Child _ Counseling CEUs</title>
      <description>What is the Inner Child?

The inner child refers to the emotional and experiential part of an individual that holds childhood memories and trauma.

Childhood trauma or unmet needs may result in emotional wounds that persist into adulthood, manifesting in behavior and relationship patterns.

Impact of Trauma on the Inner Child

Childhood trauma, such as neglect, abandonment, or emotional invalidation, can prevent children from fully processing distressing experiences.

Without resolution, these unresolved traumas continue to affect emotional regulation, trust, and self-esteem in adulthood.

Behaviors Resulting from a Wounded Inner Child

Individuals may develop behaviors like avoidance, temper tantrums, or clinginess to cope with the unresolved fear of rejection or abandonment.

These patterns often mimic survival mechanisms learned during childhood to navigate difficult family dynamics.

Core Issues Faced by the Wounded Inner Child

Common core issues include feelings of unworthiness, fear of abandonment, perfectionism, and a tendency to overcompensate to earn love or acceptance.

People with a wounded inner child may struggle with emotional regulation, self-identity, and trusting others in relationships.

Reparenting the Inner Child

Reparenting is a process where adults provide themselves with the nurturing, validation, and care that their inner child missed during childhood.

This involves learning self-compassion, setting healthy boundaries, and developing distress tolerance skills.

Strategies for Healing the Inner Child

Healing involves acknowledging the wounds of the past, processing unresolved grief, and developing new, healthier ways to cope with emotional triggers.

Techniques include mindfulness, self-awareness, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and practices aimed at fostering self-love and resilience.

Recognizing Inauthentic and False Selves

Individuals may develop inauthentic or false selves to gain approval or avoid rejection. This can manifest in perfectionism, people-pleasing, or suppressing emotions.

Healing encourages authenticity, helping individuals reconnect with their true needs, desires, and emotions.

Grieving and Letting Go

Processing grief related to childhood trauma is a necessary step in healing. It allows individuals to acknowledge and release the pain of unmet needs.

Forgiveness, both of self and others, can be part of the healing journey, though it does not mean excusing harmful behavior.

      <title>1047-Overcoming Adversity and Mastering Resilience</title>
      <description>Resilience Definition

Resilience is the capacity to bounce back from adversity, demonstrated by emotional strength and the ability to handle crises without being overwhelmed.

Resilience is like a ball that, when pushed underwater, bounces back to the surface.

Characteristics of Resilient People

Resilient individuals are self-aware, have healthy self-esteem, strong social support, and practice radical acceptance.

They possess problem-solving skills, tolerance for distress, and maintain an optimistic outlook.

Importance of Self-Awareness

Resilient individuals are aware of their vulnerabilities and strengths, both emotional and physical.

They know how to manage sources of distress, such as confusion, frustration, and negative emotions.

Self-Efficacy and Problem-Solving

Believing in one's ability to overcome challenges is a cornerstone of resilience.

Encouraging people to set small, achievable goals to build confidence and self-efficacy.

Hardiness and Commitment

Hardiness involves commitment, control, and challenge.

People who have hardiness are more likely to face challenges with confidence and view obstacles as opportunities for growth.

Managing Social Support and Relationships

Resilient individuals maintain healthy relationships characterized by empathy, trust, and openness.

They are also skilled at managing relationships with negative or critical people, protecting themselves from being affected by these relationships.

Distress Tolerance and Radical Acceptance

The ability to feel emotions without needing to react immediately is key to distress tolerance.

Radical acceptance means accepting situations that cannot be changed without judgment or resistance.

Optimism and Positive Reframing

Resilient people find silver linings in challenges and failures, viewing them as learning opportunities.

Positive reframing helps to shift the mindset from helplessness to empowerment.

Gratitude and Positivity

Gratitude practices, such as creating gratitude jars, help individuals stay focused on the positive aspects of life, even during tough times.

Identifying things to be grateful for can significantly improve emotional well-being.

      <title>1046-Helping the Inner Child Process Grief</title>
      <description>What is the Inner Child?

The inner child refers to the collection of memories and experiences from childhood.

These memories shape mental shortcuts, called schema, which influence how individuals interpret and react to present-day life events.

Children’s Cognitive Development

Children process information concretely and personally, often believing events are their fault.

The schema formed during childhood tend to be all-or-nothing and are carried into adulthood unless evaluated and adjusted.

Impact of Insecure Attachment

A lack of secure attachment in childhood can result in a "wounded" inner child.

This wounded inner child often struggles with emotional regulation, boundary-setting, and assertiveness in adulthood.

Secure Attachment and Emotional Regulation

Secure attachments help children identify and manage emotions.

These children can tolerate their own and others' emotions and effectively set boundaries and communicate needs.

Healing the Wounded Inner Child

The goal is not to eliminate the inner child but to heal wounds through self-compassion and re-parenting.

Re-parenting involves providing the inner child with the support and validation they missed during childhood.

Recognizing the Wounded Inner Child

The wounded inner child may manifest as avoidance of fun, fear, or feelings of disempowerment.

Healing begins with creating a safe internal space where the inner child feels acknowledged and supported.

Types of Trauma Affecting the Inner Child

Trauma can result from various childhood experiences such as rejection, abandonment, or unfulfilled dreams.

These traumatic memories are often stored and avoided, resulting in unresolved grief.

Techniques for Helping the Inner Child Grieve

Before grieving can occur, the inner child must feel safe and secure.

Engage in practices that foster secure attachment with the self, such as validating emotions and offering consistent support.

Mindfulness and Reconnection
Reconnect with the inner child through activities like mindfulness, reminiscing about childhood, and engaging in joyful activities that the inner child enjoys.
Cognitive Behavioral Approaches

Evaluate the child’s schema to see if they are still accurate.

Challenge all-or-nothing and self-focused beliefs formed in childhood to promote more adaptive thinking in adulthood.

      <title>1045-CBT Tools to Address Chronic Pain_ It is NOT all in your head!</title>
      <description>Biopsychosocial Impact of Pain

Chronic pain affects not just the body but also mental health, including anxiety, depression, and self-esteem.

Pain can disrupt circadian rhythms, causing sleep issues, and leads to grief due to loss of function or identity.

Types of Prevention


Primary prevention focuses on preventing pain flare-ups and pain conditions.


Secondary prevention aims at stopping pain from worsening during a flare-up.


Tertiary prevention works to prevent secondary issues like depression, addiction, or anxiety caused by chronic pain.

Evaluating Pain

Understand whether the pain is acute or chronic, its quality (e.g., stabbing, throbbing), and if it's constant or intermittent.

Behavioral health professionals should help clients identify and differentiate between "normal" pain and distress that can be managed.

Balance and Ergonomics

It's important to maintain muscular balance between different parts of the body, as imbalance can lead to spasms or worsening pain.

Pay attention to ergonomics at work, home, and even when sitting for long periods to prevent unnecessary strain.

Exercise and Stretching

Gentle movement like stretching, Tai Chi, or yoga can help with mobility and prevent stiffness, which contributes to pain.

Avoid overtraining, as this can lead to setbacks in pain management.

Nutrition and Supplements

Omega-3s, vitamin D, and antioxidants can help reduce inflammation and improve pain management.

Ensure a balanced diet, but always consult a registered dietitian or healthcare professional before making significant dietary changes.

Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS)

VNS, triggered through slow diaphragmatic breathing, promotes relaxation and can help reduce pain.

Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation (TVNS) with a TENS unit can also help manage pain and inflammation.

Stress and Pain

Chronic stress disrupts the body's ability to suppress pain and inflammation, often worsening pain.

Managing stress through relaxation, reducing alcohol, and engaging in mindfulness techniques can reduce pain's intensity.

Pharmacotherapy and Medical Interventions

Medication can help manage pain, but it often just masks the pain rather than treating the underlying cause.

Patients should work with their healthcare provider to find a balanced approach to pain management that may include over-the-counter options, opioids, or adjuvant therapies like muscle relaxants or corticosteroids.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Techniques

Use CBT to help patients change the way they think about their pain, reducing emotional distress.

Techniques like guided imagery, distraction, and radical acceptance are crucial tools for helping patients focus on what they can control and improve their quality of life despite chronic pain.

      <itunes:summary>Biopsychosocial Impact of Pain

Chronic pain affects not just the body but also mental health, including anxiety, depression, and self-esteem.

Pain can disrupt circadian rhythms, causing sleep issues, and leads to grief due to loss of function or identity.

Types of Prevention


Primary prevention focuses on preventing pain flare-ups and pain conditions.


Secondary prevention aims at stopping pain from worsening during a flare-up.


Tertiary prevention works to prevent secondary issues like depression, addiction, or anxiety caused by chronic pain.

Evaluating Pain

Understand whether the pain is acute or chronic, its quality (e.g., stabbing, throbbing), and if it's constant or intermittent.

Behavioral health professionals should help clients identify and differentiate between "normal" pain and distress that can be managed.

Balance and Ergonomics

It's important to maintain muscular balance between different parts of the body, as imbalance can lead to spasms or worsening pain.

Pay attention to ergonomics at work, home, and even when sitting for long periods to prevent unnecessary strain.

Exercise and Stretching

Gentle movement like stretching, Tai Chi, or yoga can help with mobility and prevent stiffness, which contributes to pain.

Avoid overtraining, as this can lead to setbacks in pain management.

Nutrition and Supplements

Omega-3s, vitamin D, and antioxidants can help reduce inflammation and improve pain management.

Ensure a balanced diet, but always consult a registered dietitian or healthcare professional before making significant dietary changes.

Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS)

VNS, triggered through slow diaphragmatic breathing, promotes relaxation and can help reduce pain.

Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation (TVNS) with a TENS unit can also help manage pain and inflammation.

Stress and Pain

Chronic stress disrupts the body's ability to suppress pain and inflammation, often worsening pain.

Managing stress through relaxation, reducing alcohol, and engaging in mindfulness techniques can reduce pain's intensity.

      <title>1044-Reset Your Nervous System _ Understanding the Dopamine Connection</title>
      <description>What is Dopamine?

Dopamine is often referred to as a motivation chemical rather than just a pleasure chemical.

It regulates mood, movement, energy, sleep, libido, and pain tolerance.

Dopamine plays a key role in cognitive functions like memory, attention, and decision-making.

The Concept of Dopamine Fasting


Dopamine fasting does not reduce dopamine levels but aims to reduce compulsive behaviors that overstimulate the dopaminergic system.

This approach involves reducing stimulating behaviors intermittently (e.g., hours per day or days per week) to reset the brain’s reward system.

Dopamine's Role in Addiction and Stress

Excessive stimulation, like addiction or chronic stress, can desensitize the brain to dopamine, causing reduced motivation and emotional regulation.

Conversely, trauma may cause hypervigilance, where the brain responds too strongly to stimuli due to dopamine imbalances.

Dopamine Receptors and Tolerance


Tolerance develops when dopamine receptors downregulate after prolonged overstimulation, requiring more of the same activity to get the same reward.

The nervous system naturally attempts to achieve homeostasis by adjusting receptor sensitivity and dopamine production.

Impact of Trauma on the Dopamine System

Chronic trauma and stress can lead to neurotoxic environments, which reduce the number of dopamine receptors and damage neurons.

Dopamine is also linked to systemic inflammation, further complicating its role in trauma survivors.

Dopamine Fast Alternatives

Dr. Snipes advocates for a lifestyle approach rather than short-term dopamine fasts.

This alternative focuses on reducing overall stimulation levels daily to create a sustainable balance in the nervous system.

Tools for Nervous System Rebalance


Mindful breathing, reducing caffeine, and taking regular stimulation breaks are practical ways to reduce overstimulation.


Moderate exercise, proper hydration, and practicing mindfulness can help the nervous system reset and maintain emotional regulation.

Long-Term Benefits of a Dopamine Reset

Reducing overstimulation helps rewire the brain to respond better to simple pleasures and mindful living, fostering emotional well-being.

Over time, this approach decreases reliance on compulsive behaviors and promotes a balanced, more fulfilling lifestyle.

      <title>1043-9 Powerful Tips for Rewiring an Anxious Brain_ Neuroplasticity Secrets</title>
      <description>Understanding Anxiety and the Stress Response

Anxiety is a natural emotional reaction, often triggered by physical and cognitive stressors.

It activates the body's HPA axis (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis), leading to physical reactions like increased heart rate, rapid breathing, and digestive issues.

Emotional Reasoning

Anxiety may arise from incorrect beliefs about danger, even when no real threat exists.

Emotional reasoning leads people to act as though their anxious feelings are facts.

The Brain’s Bias Toward Threats

The brain often prioritizes memories of negative or threatening experiences to keep us safe, causing anxiety when facing similar situations.

Prior bad experiences with things like aggressive dogs or natural disasters can heighten anxiety in future similar scenarios.

Mindfulness as a Rewiring Tool

Practicing mindfulness encourages individuals to focus on the present moment, reducing the brain's reliance on past fears and automatic responses.

Becoming aware of physical, cognitive, and emotional anxiety triggers allows for better emotional regulation.

Sleep and Anxiety

Lack of sleep increases the activity of the HPA axis, making it harder to manage stress and anxiety.

Good sleep hygiene is essential for maintaining mental and emotional balance.

Physical Sensations and Anxiety
Bodily sensations like pain or low blood sugar can mimic or trigger anxiety responses, creating a feedback loop of stress and discomfort.
Nutrition and Anxiety

Blood sugar fluctuations, often caused by poor diet, can worsen anxiety.

Maintaining stable blood sugar through balanced nutrition can help manage anxious feelings.

Distress Tolerance Techniques

Tools like slow breathing, guided imagery, and physical activity help calm the stress response and regain emotional control.


Cognitive-behavioral strategies such as reframing anxious thoughts are effective for reducing anxiety.

Rewriting Core Beliefs

Writing down and challenging negative thoughts helps rewire the brain.

Identifying cognitive distortions like all-or-nothing thinking, magnification, and personalization can improve emotional resilience.

      <title>1041-Understanding Unique Needs of BDSM Practitioners_ A Counselors Guide</title>
      <description>Understanding BDSM

BDSM involves consensual sexual practices including bondage, dominance, submission, and sadomasochism.

The core principle is that all activities must be safe, sane, and consensual.

The Role of Counselors

Therapists must provide a non-judgmental space for clients practicing BDSM.

Recognizing biases and understanding the nature of BDSM relationships is essential to competent care.

Common Myths and Misconceptions

BDSM is not inherently linked to psychopathology or trauma.

It does not increase the likelihood of mental illness or indicate that the person was abused.

Relationship Dynamics in BDSM

BDSM relationships often involve clear communication and negotiated roles, including dominance and submission.

Role flexibility, including "switches," is common, allowing participants to alternate between dominant and submissive roles.

Addressing Concerns in Therapy

Counselors should address physical and psychological safety, ensuring clients do not feel judged.

BDSM is a practice for many that fosters empowerment, trust, and intimacy.

Physical and Psychological Risks

While BDSM is practiced safely by many, there is potential for harm if boundaries are not respected.

Awareness of physical risks, such as injury from bondage or breath play, is crucial.

Consent and Communication

BDSM requires high levels of consent and communication before, during, and after scenes (activities).

Aftercare is essential to ensure emotional and physical well-being post-BDSM activity.

      <title>1040-Sexual Diversity &amp; Kink_ What Every Counselor Should Know</title>
      <description>Overview of Kink and Sexual Diversity

Kink is a broad term that includes alternative sexual practices like BDSM, polyamory, and consensual non-monogamy.

Kink behaviors often fall outside of mainstream practices, but they are a normal part of sexual diversity for many people.

DSM-5's View on Kink

Kink-related behaviors, including BDSM and fetishism, are no longer considered mental disorders unless they cause harm or involve non-consensual acts.

It's essential to differentiate between consensual kink and problematic behaviors that cause distress or harm.

Mental Health Impacts

For many, kink activities provide empowerment, emotional expression, and fulfillment.

However, stigma around kink can lead to shame, guilt, and even suicidal ideation if individuals feel judged or isolated for their preferences.

Safe, Sane, and Consensual Practices

A key principle in kink is that all activities must be safe, sane, and consensual.

Proper training and open communication are crucial to ensure that participants engage safely and have the ability to withdraw consent at any time.

Debunking Myths

Kink participants are not necessarily dealing with trauma, nor is kink inherently linked to psychological issues.

Many participants in kink lead healthy, well-balanced lives, and their practices are simply part of their sexual identity.

Clinician’s Role

Therapists must create a non-judgmental, supportive environment for clients to discuss kink without fear of stigma.

Recognizing one's biases and educating oneself on kink-related practices is essential to providing competent care.

Communication and Education

Encouraging open, honest communication between partners in kink relationships helps maintain trust and safety.

Platforms like FetLife and local "munches" provide safe spaces for kink individuals to meet and learn in non-sexual settings.

Polyamory and Consensual Non-Monogamy

Polyamory is distinct from casual or open relationships and involves committed, loving relationships with multiple people.

Consent and communication are key, and therapists should understand the dynamics to better assist clients practicing these relationship models.

      <title>1039-What to Do When You Love Your Therapist</title>
      <description>Understanding Transference

Transference is when a client projects feelings onto their therapist, often reflecting unmet needs or emotional experiences from other relationships.

It's common to develop strong feelings for a therapist, especially if they provide safety, validation, and emotional support.

Therapeutic Relationships as Safe Spaces

Therapists often provide one of the first healthy, secure relationships for clients, leading to feelings of attachment.

The feeling of security and validation in therapy can be a source of comfort, which might cause clients to think about their therapist outside of sessions.

Recognizing Dependency

Continuously thinking about your therapist or watching their videos might signal emotional dependency.

It is essential to differentiate between the therapist’s tools and personal presence in providing support.

Addressing the Issue in Therapy

Clients are encouraged to discuss feelings of attachment with their therapist to work through them.

If emotional support from the therapist is lacking, it’s crucial to communicate these needs and seek a solution.

Impact on Romantic Relationships

Feelings towards the therapist may arise due to unmet emotional needs in a primary relationship, such as a spouse.

Exploring how the therapist meets emotional needs can help clients work towards fostering similar feelings of safety and validation with their partner.

Managing Therapy Termination

Ending therapy can be difficult for clients who feel strongly attached to their therapist.

Gradual termination, where sessions decrease in frequency, helps clients adjust to applying therapeutic tools independently while maintaining the option of returning if needed.

      <title>1038-Discover How Dopamine Impacts Serotonin, Hormones and Happiness</title>
      <description>Dopamine’s Role in the Body

Dopamine is essential for motivation, pleasure, and reward processing.

It plays a role in digestion, immune response, and inflammation regulation.

Dopamine is found in various parts of the body, including the brain, immune system, kidneys, and pancreas.

Dopamine and Other Neurotransmitters

Dopamine interacts with neurotransmitters like serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA, and others.

An imbalance in dopamine can affect mood, sleep, attention, and motivation.

Altering one neurotransmitter, such as dopamine, can impact others, causing a cascade effect.

Effects of Dopamine Imbalance


Excess dopamine can lead to psychosis, mania, ADHD-like symptoms, and addictive behaviors.


Dopamine deficiency is linked to depression, lack of motivation (anhedonia), Parkinson’s disease, and Restless Legs Syndrome.

Dopamine and Hormones

Dopamine influences the release of hormones like oxytocin, estrogen, and testosterone.

Disruptions in dopamine function can impact social bonding, anxiety, addiction, and even fertility-related conditions like PCOS.

Mental Health and Dopamine

Low dopamine is associated with mood disorders such as depression and post-acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS) in addiction recovery.

Dopamine plays a crucial role in PTSD, where prolonged stress can deplete dopamine levels, leading to more severe symptoms.

Ways to Balance Dopamine Naturally

Natural ways to regulate dopamine include sufficient sleep, balanced nutrition (rich in tyrosine), exercise, and reducing chronic stress.

Avoid overstimulation from sugars, caffeine, and artificial stimulants to prevent dopamine flooding and depletion.

Medications and Treatments

Medications like SSRIs, antipsychotics, and dopamine agonists/antagonists can alter dopamine levels, but they need to be carefully managed to avoid side effects.

In addiction recovery, restoring dopamine balance is crucial for long-term recovery and mental health stabilization.

      <title>1037-Gut Health and Mental Health: The Impact of the Second Brain</title>
      <description>The Gut-Brain Connection

The gut and brain communicate bidirectionally through pathways such as the vagus nerve and endocrine signals.

Changes in the gut microbiome can affect brain functions, triggering or worsening mood disorders like anxiety, depression, and PTSD.

Stress and the Gut

Stress affects the gut directly via neuronal signals and indirectly by impacting the gut's bacterial composition.

When the gut is out of balance, it can worsen stress responses, creating a cycle of dysregulation between the brain and gut.

Gut Microbiome and Mental Health Disorders

Studies show links between gut health and conditions like ADHD, autism, depression, and even dementia.

An imbalanced microbiome can lead to systemic inflammation, which has been associated with several mental health and cognitive disorders.

Role of Diet and Nutrition

Diet plays a crucial role in maintaining gut health. Foods high in fiber and probiotics support a healthy microbiome.

Comfort foods high in sugar and fat might initially boost mood, but they can later increase stress levels due to the way they affect gut bacteria.

Probiotics and Treatment
Probiotics, found in foods like yogurt and fermented products, have been shown to help balance the gut microbiome, which can alleviate symptoms of anxiety, depression, and cognitive decline.
Inflammation and Gut Permeability
A leaky gut allows toxins to enter the bloodstream, which can increase systemic inflammation and potentially contribute to brain inflammation, further affecting mood and cognition.
Influence of Hormones

Hormonal fluctuations (e.g., menopause, postpartum, testosterone deficiency) affect the gut microbiome, and vice versa.

Addressing gut health may help mitigate symptoms related to hormonal changes, such as postpartum depression.

      <title>1036-How to Avoid 5 Group Therapy Leadership Mistakes</title>
      <description>Role of the Group Leader

The leader is responsible for guiding group dynamics.

Must adjust leadership style to the group’s stage (forming, storming, norming).

Leadership involves setting the group’s tone and level of engagement.

Leadership Style

Leaders can vary from hands-off to active facilitators.

Psychoeducational groups might require more structured leadership than therapeutic processing groups.

It’s essential to know when to intervene and allow group members to practice communication and boundary-setting skills.

Group Development Phases

Groups pass through stages (forming, storming, norming).

Early stages often involve high anxiety; leaders need strategies to manage this.

Creating a Safe Environment

The group room often mirrors the outside world, offering a place to practice coping skills.

The leader is responsible for guiding group dynamics.

Must adjust leadership style to the group’s stage (forming, storming, norming).

Leadership involves setting the group’s tone and level of engagement.

Leadership Style

Psychoeducational groups might require more structured leadership than therapeutic processing groups.

It’s essential to know when to intervene and allow group members to practice communication and boundary-setting skills.

Group Development Phases

Groups pass through stages (forming, storming, norming).

Early stages often involve high anxiety; leaders need strategies to manage this.

      <title>1034-The Hardest Part About Diagnoses (And How To Avoid Biases)</title>
      <description>1. Introduction to Diagnoses and Framing Bias



Framing Bias: A cognitive bias affecting how information is perceived based on how it is presented.


Importance of Broad Evaluations: Symptoms like fatigue could have various causes (e.g., hormonal imbalance, cardiovascular issues, substance withdrawal).

2. Common Mental Health Diagnoses



Mental Health Disorders: ADHD, anxiety, autism, depression, and schizophrenia are common diagnoses that require differential evaluation.


Physical Causes of Symptoms: It’s essential not to overlook physiological factors like low testosterone, thyroid issues, or vitamin deficiencies that can mimic or exacerbate mental health symptoms.

3. The Role of Bias in Diagnosis



Confirmation Bias: Clinicians may be more likely to diagnose based on expected symptoms, which can lead to misdiagnosis.


Availability Heuristic: Media coverage of disorders can lead to an increase in diagnoses because clinicians or patients are more aware of certain symptoms.

4. Diagnosing Beyond Labels



Over-Diagnosis Risk: Assigning multiple diagnoses (e.g., PTSD, depression, anxiety) can overwhelm patients, making them feel broken.


Focus on Symptoms: Instead of focusing on diagnostic labels, it’s important to address the root causes of symptoms for effective treatment.

5. Interplay of Physical and Mental Health



Comprehensive Bio-Psycho-Social Diagnosis: Mental health professionals must consider physical health, emotional well-being, cognitive functions, and interpersonal relationships.


Hormonal and Neurotransmitter Balance: Hormones like cortisol, estrogen, and testosterone, as well as neurotransmitters, play a vital role in mood regulation and overall mental health.

6. Managing Cognitive Biases in Healthcare



Critical Thinking: Avoid jumping to conclusions based on first impressions or limited information.


Holistic Approach: Incorporate a wide range of physiological, emotional, and environmental factors when evaluating a patient.

7. Consequences of Ignoring Physical Health


Medical Referrals: Mental health professionals should collaborate with medical providers to rule out underlying medical conditions that might manifest as psychological symptoms.

      <title>1033-The Surprising Connection Between Adverse Childhood Experiences and Intergenerational Trauma</title>
      <description>MERRY CHRISTMAS!

1. Introduction to Intergenerational Trauma



Definition of Trauma: Trauma occurs when an individual experiences events that leave them feeling unsafe and powerless.


Intergenerational Trauma: Trauma that is passed down through generations, impacting not only the person who experienced it but also their children and grandchildren.

2. Types of Trauma



Physical Trauma: Examples include injuries or illnesses that change life circumstances.


Emotional Trauma: This can stem from unresolved emotional issues, leading to long-term feelings of helplessness.


Environmental Trauma: Major life changes or disasters can cause lasting trauma.


Spiritual Trauma: A loss of connection with one's values, beliefs, or higher power.

3. Impact of Trauma on Physical and Emotional Health



Grief and Loss: Trauma often results in a loss of security, hopes, or dreams, leading to grief.


Cognitive Changes: Trauma can alter how individuals think about themselves and the world, leading to confusion or black-and-white thinking.


Interpersonal Effects: Trauma affects relationships, often causing difficulty in trusting others.

4. Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma



Attachment Issues: Trauma can disrupt attachment bonds between parents and children, leading to insecure attachment styles.


Caregiver Impact: Caregivers who experienced trauma may struggle with consistency and emotional availability, further perpetuating trauma in their children.


Behavioral Manifestations: Trauma can lead to patterns of behavior such as codependency, emotional detachment, or hypervigilance, which are passed down through generations.

5. Breaking the Cycle of Trauma



Mindfulness and Self-Awareness: Acknowledging and addressing personal trauma is the first step toward healing and breaking the cycle.


Developing Secure Attachment: Focus on being consistent, attentive, and responsive to one's own needs and the needs of others.


Emotional Intelligence: Teaching emotional awareness and distress tolerance helps prevent trauma from being passed down to future generations.

      <title>1032-How GABA And Glutamate Control Your Brain and Stress Response</title>
      <description>1. Overview of GABA and Glutamate



GABA: The brain's main inhibitory neurotransmitter, responsible for calming the central nervous system.


Glutamate: The brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitter, promoting alertness and cognitive function.

Both neurotransmitters are crucial for maintaining a balance between stimulation and relaxation.

2. Functions and Balance



Goldilocks Principle: Both GABA and glutamate must be in proper balance—too much or too little leads to problems.


Stress Response: Under stress, glutamate is released, which triggers fight-or-flight responses. GABA is needed to calm the system down afterward.


Alcohol and GABA: Alcohol temporarily increases GABA, providing a calming effect, but as it leaves the body, anxiety can spike.

3. Symptoms of Imbalance



Excess Glutamate: Leads to chronic stress, anxiety, and can result in neurotoxicity, contributing to inflammation and mental health issues.


Low GABA: Results in heightened anxiety, poor concentration, sleep issues, and muscle tension.


Chronic Conditions: Imbalance in GABA and glutamate is linked to conditions like PTSD, generalized anxiety, and depression.

4. Diet and Neurotransmitter Production



Nutrient Deficiency: Without adequate nutrients, the body can't produce enough GABA or glutamate.


Gut Health: Gut inflammation or stress can affect nutrient absorption and neurotransmitter production.


Foods that Support GABA: Whole grains, nuts, spinach, yogurt, and fermented foods can promote GABA production.

5. Pharmaceutical and Natural Modulation



Pharmaceuticals: Benzodiazepines and SSRIs are commonly used to increase GABA or serotonin levels but may not always target the correct imbalance.


Natural Remedies: Supplements like valerian root, passionflower, and certain teas can increase GABA naturally, but must be used carefully to avoid excessive calm or depression.

      <title>1029-Explore the Link Between Sex-Hormones and Mental Health</title>
      <description>1. Overview of Sex Hormones and Mental Health



Key Hormones: Estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone are crucial for mood regulation.


Cortisol Impact: The stress hormone cortisol influences sex hormones and mental health.


Hormone Balance: The “Goldilocks principle” applies, as both low and high levels of these hormones can affect mental well-being.

2. Estrogen's Role



Mood Regulation: Estrogen enhances serotonin and endorphin production, affecting mood.


Estrogen in Men and Women: While often associated with women, estrogen also plays a role in male mental health.


Impact on Anxiety and Depression: Low or fluctuating estrogen can increase the risk of mood disorders, especially in perimenopause or postpartum phases.

3. Progesterone and Its Anti-Anxiety Effects



Calming Influence: Progesterone activates GABA, the brain's natural calming neurotransmitter.


Stress Buffer: It reduces the effects of stress and helps balance estrogen levels.

4. Testosterone and Mental Health



Key Role in Both Genders: Testosterone affects mood, motivation, and cognitive function in both men and women.


Low Testosterone Symptoms: Fatigue, anxiety, and low libido are common with low testosterone, especially in aging males.


Effects on Dopamine and Serotonin: Testosterone influences dopamine and serotonin systems, affecting motivation and mood regulation.

5. Interconnectedness of Hormones and Neurotransmitters



Cortisol and Testosterone Relationship: High cortisol can suppress testosterone, leading to mood disturbances.


Gut Health and Hormones: The gut microbiome plays a role in hormone production, affecting mental health.

      <title>1028-The Shocking Link Between Hydration and Mental Health</title>
      <description>1. Importance of Hydration for Mental Health



Hydration Impact: Dehydration affects mood, cognitive abilities, and overall health.


Under-recognized Factor: Hydration is often overlooked in mental health care, but it is crucial for body and brain function.

2. Physical and Mental Symptoms of Dehydration



Shared Symptoms: Fatigue, headaches, mood changes, and cognitive difficulties are common in both dehydration and mood disorders.


Worsening Mental Health: Chronic dehydration can exacerbate symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress.

3. Environmental and Lifestyle Factors



Heat and Physical Activity: Excessive sweating due to heat or physical work requires more water intake.


Caffeine and Alcohol: Both act as diuretics, intensifying dehydration.

4. Chronic Dehydration in Special Populations



Children and the Elderly: Often more vulnerable due to school restrictions on water intake or reduced thirst sensation in older adults.


Chronic Dehydration in Low-Income Areas: Contaminated water supplies and poor access to clean water can compound health issues.

5. Effects of Dehydration on Cognitive and Emotional Functioning



Cognitive Impairment: Slower reaction times, brain fog, and impaired decision-making can result from inadequate hydration.


Emotional Dysregulation: Increased irritability and emotional instability are common when dehydration disrupts hormonal and neurotransmitter balance.

      <itunes:summary>1. Importance of Hydration for Mental Health



Hydration Impact: Dehydration affects mood, cognitive abilities, and overall health.


Under-recognized Factor: Hydration is often overlooked in mental health care, but it is crucial for body and brain function.

2. Physical and Mental Symptoms of Dehydration



Shared Symptoms: Fatigue, headaches, mood changes, and cognitive difficulties are common in both dehydration and mood disorders.


Worsening Mental Health: Chronic dehydration can exacerbate symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress.

3. Environmental and Lifestyle Factors



Heat and Physical Activity: Excessive sweating due to heat or physical work requires more water intake.


Caffeine and Alcohol: Both act as diuretics, intensifying dehydration.

4. Chronic Dehydration in Special Populations



Children and the Elderly: Often more vulnerable due to school restrictions on water intake or reduced thirst sensation in older adults.


Chronic Dehydration in Low-Income Areas: Contaminated water supplies and poor access to clean water can compound health issues.

5. Effects of Dehydration on Cognitive and Emotional Functioning



Cognitive Impairment: Slower reaction times, brain fog, and impaired decision-making can result from inadequate hydration.


Emotional Dysregulation: Increased irritability and emotional instability are common when dehydration disrupts hormonal and neurotransmitter balance.

      <title>1025-The Relapse Trap_ H.A.L.T. Warning Signs Exposed</title>
      <description>1. Introduction to H.A.L.T.



H.A.L.T.: Mnemonic for four major relapse triggers: Hungry, Angry, Lonely, and Tired.

These states make individuals more susceptible to stress, which can lead to relapse in various aspects of life (addiction, mental health, etc.).

2. Hunger – Physical and Beyond



Physical Hunger: Basic need for food, water, pain relief.


Broader Meaning: Desire for emotional, interpersonal, and cognitive fulfillment.


Spiritual Aspect: Hunger for connection with others who share similar values and beliefs.

3. Anger and Anxiety – Fight or Flight Responses



Anger as a Response: Linked to a perceived threat and vulnerability.


Effects: Prolonged anger can cause systemic inflammation, poor sleep, and lead to relapse.


Management: Recognizing anger and anxiety, using distress tolerance skills to prevent escalation.

4. Loneliness – Disconnection and Fear of Rejection



Loneliness Rooted in Disconnection: Can stem from fear of rejection, lack of external validation, or diminished self-worth.


Impact on Recovery: Isolation in addiction recovery or physical limitations can trigger loneliness, leading to a higher risk of relapse.

5. Tiredness – Physical and Emotional Exhaustion



Physical Exhaustion: Obvious need for rest and recovery.


Emotional and Cognitive Exhaustion: Overthinking or dealing with unresolved emotional issues can lead to fatigue.


Recovery Strategy: Balance rest and proactive recovery actions to prevent burnout and relapse.

      <title>1023-Expert Advice for Navigating Family Changes</title>
      <description>Introduction


Presenter: Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes discusses helping families navigate life transitions using the Flower Empower Model.

The focus is on understanding how various transitions impact both individuals and families, emphasizing the importance of supportive partnerships between clinicians and families.

Defining Life Transitions


What Are Life Transitions?: Transitions can be both positive (e.g., getting married, having a baby) and negative (e.g., divorce, illness). Regardless, they can cause stress.


Impact on Families: Each family member is affected differently during transitions, such as moving, illness, or marriage. These changes require both individual and collective adjustment.

The Flower Empower Model


Core Concept: The model emphasizes the clinician-family partnership, where clinicians work with families to assess needs and foster a supportive environment.


Vision and Values: The focus is on respect, individual definitions of family, and recognizing the diverse needs of family members during transitions.


Principles of the Model: Emphasizes care, empathy, responsibility, and safety in supporting families through transitions.

Common Life Transitions


Marriage and Divorce: These significant life changes impact everyone in the family, requiring adaptation and emotional support.


Illness and Caregiving: Chronic illness (e.g., cancer, Alzheimer’s) introduces new caregiving needs and role shifts within the family.


Moving: Relocation brings stress related to loss of familiar environments, support systems, and routines, impacting children and adults alike.

Challenges of Life Transitions


Loss and Grief: Every transition involves loss, whether it’s time, friendships, or lifestyle changes. Grieving these losses is part of the adjustment process.


Stress Management: Families must learn to manage the stress that comes with change, as well as the ripple effects it creates within the family unit.

The Role of Clinicians


Partnership and Support: Clinicians play a key role in facilitating family transitions by assessing needs, offering resources, and providing emotional support.


Education and Advocacy: Families often need help navigating systems (e.g., health care, resources). Clinicians assist in linking families to appropriate services.

Conclusion

The Flower Empower Model offers a comprehensive framework for guiding families through life transitions.

By fostering strong clinician-family partnerships and addressing both individual and collective needs, families can navigate transitions with greater resilience and support.

      <title>1022-Psychological Abuse &amp; Trauma Bonds in Codependency _  Interview with Lindsay Villandry (Part 1)</title>
      <description>Introduction


Presenter: Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes discusses psychological abuse, trauma, and the healing process.

The focus is on different forms of abuse, relational trauma, and their long-lasting impacts on mental health and interpersonal relationships.

Types of Abuse


Forms of Abuse: Abuse can be emotional, physical, financial, or sexual. Emotional abuse and neglect are particularly harmful, often having more severe long-term effects than physical abuse.


Impact of Words: Hurtful words from significant others or caregivers can have deep emotional consequences. Victims may start doubting their own self-worth, questioning their perceptions of love and safety.

Relational Trauma and Hypervigilance


Relational Trauma: Emotional abuse leaves individuals feeling unsafe and powerless, affecting their ability to form healthy relationships.


Hypervigilance: Survivors of trauma often become hyper-aware, constantly scanning for threats in relationships and interpreting benign actions as harmful.

Psychological Manipulation: Gaslighting


Gaslighting Defined: A form of manipulation where the abuser tries to make the victim doubt their own reality, making them feel crazy or powerless.


Example: The victim might feel confused and question their own memory or sanity when told that their version of events never happened.

Trauma and Addictive Relationships


Addictive Behaviors: Trauma often leads to addictive behaviors, not just with substances but also with relationships. People may remain in harmful relationships despite negative consequences, mirroring the cycle of substance addiction.


Emotional Attachment: Addictive relationships can be illogical, where individuals keep returning to toxic relationships because of emotional trauma, even when it’s harmful.

Narcissism and Personality Disorders


Narcissism vs. Narcissistic Personality Disorder: Narcissistic traits and behaviors, while common, do not necessarily mean someone has Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). True NPD involves grandiosity, lack of empathy, and a tendency to manipulate others for personal gain.


Behavior as Communication: Narcissistic behaviors may communicate insecurity, fear, or the need for validation, and are often misunderstood as purely selfish or arrogant.

Attachment Theory and Personality Development


Attachment Styles: Early relationships with caregivers shape attachment styles, which influence how individuals form relationships later in life.


Anxious Attachment: Involves constantly seeking validation from others.


Avoidant Attachment: Results from neglect or criticism, leading individuals to avoid emotional closeness.


Disorganized Attachment: A combination of anxious and avoidant tendencies, often developed from inconsistent caregiving.


Impact of Insecure Attachment: When children experience inconsistent or neglectful caregiving, they struggle to form secure attachments, leading to emotional difficulties as adults.

Trauma and Personality Disorders

Personality Disorders and Trauma: Personality disorders, like NPD or borderline personality disorder, often stem from early childhood trauma and chaotic environments. These disorders are coping mechanisms developed to survive difficult situations.
Healing and Recovery


Healing Through Self-Awareness: Understanding attachment styles, trauma, and the effects of emotional abuse is the first step in healing.


Enmeshment and Boundaries: Enmeshment, where caregivers overly control a child’s thoughts and emotions, can lead to difficulties in forming autonomy. Healing involves learning to set boundaries and develop a healthy sense of self.

      <itunes:summary>Introduction


Presenter: Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes discusses psychological abuse, trauma, and the healing process.

The focus is on different forms of abuse, relational trauma, and their long-lasting impacts on mental health and interpersonal relationships.

Types of Abuse


Forms of Abuse: Abuse can be emotional, physical, financial, or sexual. Emotional abuse and neglect are particularly harmful, often having more severe long-term effects than physical abuse.


Impact of Words: Hurtful words from significant others or caregivers can have deep emotional consequences. Victims may start doubting their own self-worth, questioning their perceptions of love and safety.

Relational Trauma and Hypervigilance


Relational Trauma: Emotional abuse leaves individuals feeling unsafe and powerless, affecting their ability to form healthy relationships.


Hypervigilance: Survivors of trauma often become hyper-aware, constantly scanning for threats in relationships and interpreting benign actions as harmful.

Psychological Manipulation: Gaslighting


Gaslighting Defined: A form of manipulation where the abuser tries to make the victim doubt their own reality, making them feel crazy or powerless.


Example: The victim might feel confused and question their own memory or sanity when told that their version of events never happened.

Trauma and Addictive Relationships


Addictive Behaviors: Trauma often leads to addictive behaviors, not just with substances but also with relationships. People may remain in harmful relationships despite negative consequences, mirroring the cycle of substance addiction.


Emotional Attachment: Addictive relationships can be illogical, where individuals keep returning to toxic relationships because of emotional trauma, even when it’s harmful.

Narcissism and Personality Disorders


Narcissism vs. Narcissistic Personality Disorder: Narcissistic traits and behaviors, while common, do not necessarily mean someone has Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). True NPD involves grandiosity, lack of empathy, and a tendency to manipulate others for personal gain.


Behavior as Communication: Narcissistic behaviors may communicate insecurity, fear, or the need for validation, and are often misunderstood as purely selfish or arrogant.

Attachment Theory and Personality Development


Attachment Styles: Early relationships with caregivers shape attachment styles, which influence how individuals form relationships later in life.


Anxious Attachment: Involves constantly seeking validation from others.


Avoidant Attachment: Results from neglect or criticism, leading individuals to avoid emotional closeness.


Disorganized Attachment: A combination of anxious and avoidant tendencies, often developed from inconsistent caregiving.


Impact of Insecure Attachment: When children experience inconsistent or neglectful caregiving, they struggle to form secure attachments, leading to emotional difficulties as adults.

Trauma and Personality Disorders

Personality Disorders and Trauma: Personality disorders, like NPD or borderline personality disorder, often stem from early childhood trauma and chaotic environments. These disorders are coping mechanisms developed to survive difficult situations.

      <title>1021-Overcoming Adversity_ Resilience Tips Unveiled</title>
      <description>Introduction


Presenter: Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes introduces the concepts of hardiness and resilience.

Hardiness and resilience are essential for coping with stress and bouncing back from adversity.

The goal is to explore ways to strengthen these traits through various psychological tools and practices.

Defining Resilience and Hardiness


Resilience: The capacity to bounce back from challenges, much like a beach ball rising to the surface when pushed underwater.


Hardiness: A psychological toolkit that helps foster resilience, consisting of three components: Commitment, Control, and Challenge (the "Three Cs").

Characteristics of Resilient Individuals


Awareness of Vulnerabilities: Resilient people recognize and minimize their physical, emotional, and mental vulnerabilities.


Secure Attachment: Strong relationships with self and others; reliance on internal validation, not external approval.


Healthy Self-Esteem: They do not depend on others for validation and maintain a positive sense of self-worth.


Self-Awareness: Just like maintaining a car, awareness of personal needs and stress levels helps prevent burnout or breakdown.


Self-Efficacy: A belief in one's ability to influence outcomes and handle adversity effectively.

Hardiness: The Foundation for Resilience


Commitment: Being deeply involved and committed to important aspects of life, like family, work, or personal values, helps in maintaining perspective during tough times.


Control: Focusing on what can be controlled rather than wasting energy on what cannot be changed.


Challenge: Viewing difficulties as opportunities for growth rather than insurmountable obstacles.

Enhancing Resilience


Acceptance: Resilient individuals accept the reality of situations, focusing on what they can control and how to move forward.


Problem-Solving Skills: Flexibility in problem-solving is key to resilience. This includes thinking outside the box when a standard solution isn’t available.


Distress Tolerance: Learning to sit with uncomfortable emotions without acting impulsively is crucial for maintaining balance.

Managing Energy and Vulnerabilities


Energy Management: Like a smartphone battery, energy is limited and must be conserved. Poor nutrition, sleep deprivation, and chronic stress all drain energy, making it harder to bounce back.


Physical and Emotional Stressors: Awareness of environmental, physical, and emotional triggers helps individuals manage their vulnerabilities and maintain balance.

Building Resilience in Everyday Life


Interpersonal Relationships: A strong social support system is crucial, but relationships also require energy. Setting boundaries with others is essential to prevent burnout.


Cognitive Strategies: Resilient people practice optimism, avoid catastrophic thinking, and focus on practical, positive problem-solving.

Conclusion

Resilience is not about eliminating stress but learning to manage it effectively.

With awareness, acceptance, and the practice of problem-solving, individuals can enhance their ability to bounce back from life’s challenges.

The PIECES model (Physical, Interpersonal, Emotional, Cognitive, Environmental, and Spiritual) helps guide a comprehensive approach to resilience-building.

      <title>1020-Changing Expectations_ How Beliefs Impact Mental Health</title>
      <description>Introduction


Presenter: Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes discusses the impact of schemas on anxiety and depression.

The presentation explores how schemas (mental shortcuts or belief systems) are formed, how they affect the mind-body connection, and strategies to address unhelpful schemas.

Understanding Schema


Definition: Schemas are mental representations or beliefs about people, events, or places formed from past experiences. They help predict future situations based on these past experiences.


Example: Driving to a stoplight – based on previous experience, you know a yellow light signals that it will soon turn red. Similarly, life experiences shape our expectations in relationships, work, and personal safety.

Formation and Impact of Schema

Schemas develop from cultural messages, personal experiences, and interpretations of those experiences. Over time, schemas may become inaccurate or outdated, leading to faulty predictions.


Trauma: Trauma can lead to schemas where individuals feel powerless and unsafe, contributing to chronic stress, anxiety, and depression. These schemas can cause overgeneralization, making a person feel like no one is trustworthy or that no place is safe.


Negative Impact on Health: Chronic stress from faulty schemas affects the gut microbiome, alters neurotransmitter levels, and impairs sleep, exacerbating mental health issues.

Addressing Faulty Schemas


Cognitive Restructuring: Identifying faulty schemas and challenging their accuracy in the present context is essential. For instance, realizing that past experiences may not accurately reflect current realities helps reduce anxiety.


Distress Tolerance: Learning how to manage emotional distress enables individuals to avoid automatic, stress-based responses, allowing them to make better decisions in the moment.


Environmental and Situational Analysis: By acknowledging that not all situations or people are the same, individuals can adjust their schema based on new, more accurate information.

Examples of Faulty Schemas


Generalization: Previous negative experiences with authority figures (e.g., doctors or law enforcement) can lead to a generalized distrust, even when the current situation may be safe.


Self-Schema: Individuals may develop beliefs about their self-worth and competence based on negative feedback from past relationships, leading to anxiety and depression in current situations.


Safety Schema: Children or adults with a history of trauma may develop hypervigilant responses to everyday situations, constantly interpreting them as dangerous due to ingrained safety-related schemas.

Strategies for Schema Modification


Schema Awareness: Recognizing when a schema is being triggered by monitoring emotional reactions.


Schema Journaling: Writing down experiences and examining whether the schema applied to the situation was accurate, helps in modifying outdated beliefs.


Therapist Support: Professionals can guide individuals through the process of schema identification and restructuring, helping them replace maladaptive beliefs with more constructive ones.

Conclusion

Schemas are powerful lenses through which we interpret the world. While they provide mental shortcuts, they often need to be revised as we gain new information or encounter new situations.

Through cognitive restructuring, distress tolerance, and a supportive therapeutic environment, individuals can modify unhelpful schemas, leading to improved mental health and resilience.

      <title>1019-Transform Your Mental Health with the PIECES Method</title>
      <description>Introduction


Presenter: Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes introduces the PIECES model for understanding mental health and life balance.

The PIECES model examines six key dimensions of life: Physical, Interpersonal, Emotional, Cognitive, Environmental, and Spiritual.

The aim is to look beyond singular or dual approaches to treatment by considering how these dimensions interact.

PIECES Model Overview


Physical Dimension: Health, energy, and pain management impact overall mood and cognitive function. Chronic conditions or poor health exacerbate mental health issues.


Interpersonal Dimension: Relationships, attachment, and social support are key to emotional stability. Healthy attachment increases neurotransmitters like serotonin and oxytocin, contributing to better moods and higher pain tolerance.


Emotional Dimension: Addressing distress tolerance, regulation, and emotional intelligence is essential. Negative emotions like anger, guilt, and resentment need to be understood and managed effectively.


Cognitive Dimension: Thoughts based on past traumas or outdated schemas contribute to ongoing distress. Cognitive distortions can throw hormones and neurotransmitters out of balance, affecting mental and physical health.


Environmental Dimension: Factors like light, air quality, and temperature directly impact mood and energy. Simple changes in environment, like improving light exposure or reducing pollutants, can improve mental health.


Spiritual Dimension: Connection to one’s values and a sense of belonging play a significant role in mental health. Misalignment between values and behavior can lead to moral injury and feelings of isolation.

Issues with Current Treatment Approaches

Many current treatment methods, such as antidepressants or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), show limited effectiveness, helping only 40-60% of patients.

Medications like antidepressants, while helpful, do not work for everyone and often leave a significant percentage of patients still struggling.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution; many people benefit more from multidimensional approaches than from medication alone.

Interaction of PIECES

Dr. Snipes emphasizes the bidirectional interaction between the PIECES dimensions. For example:

Pain affects mood, which increases inflammation, worsening the pain.

Anxiety makes it difficult to implement cognitive-behavioral strategies, particularly during high-stress periods.

Treating just one dimension (like prescribing medication for mood) may not be enough without addressing other contributing factors, such as lifestyle, physical health, and environmental stressors.

The Role of Counselors and Therapists


Multidisciplinary Referrals: It’s essential for therapists to work with other professionals (e.g., dieticians, physical therapists) to address a client’s physical health and environmental factors.


Therapeutic Relationship: The bond between client and therapist is more crucial than any specific technique in achieving long-term success.


Client-Centered Approach: Dr. Snipes stresses the importance of involving clients in their treatment plan, empowering them to decide what dimensions of their life they are most motivated to address.

Conclusion

The PIECES model encourages a holistic, transdiagnostic approach to mental health, recognizing that multiple life dimensions interact to contribute to distress.

By focusing on personalized, multi-dimensional treatment plans, therapists can help clients achieve more meaningful, sustainable improvement in their mental health and overall well-being.

      <itunes:summary>Introduction


Presenter: Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes introduces the PIECES model for understanding mental health and life balance.

The PIECES model examines six key dimensions of life: Physical, Interpersonal, Emotional, Cognitive, Environmental, and Spiritual.

The aim is to look beyond singular or dual approaches to treatment by considering how these dimensions interact.

PIECES Model Overview


Physical Dimension: Health, energy, and pain management impact overall mood and cognitive function. Chronic conditions or poor health exacerbate mental health issues.


Interpersonal Dimension: Relationships, attachment, and social support are key to emotional stability. Healthy attachment increases neurotransmitters like serotonin and oxytocin, contributing to better moods and higher pain tolerance.


Emotional Dimension: Addressing distress tolerance, regulation, and emotional intelligence is essential. Negative emotions like anger, guilt, and resentment need to be understood and managed effectively.


Cognitive Dimension: Thoughts based on past traumas or outdated schemas contribute to ongoing distress. Cognitive distortions can throw hormones and neurotransmitters out of balance, affecting mental and physical health.


Environmental Dimension: Factors like light, air quality, and temperature directly impact mood and energy. Simple changes in environment, like improving light exposure or reducing pollutants, can improve mental health.


Spiritual Dimension: Connection to one’s values and a sense of belonging play a significant role in mental health. Misalignment between values and behavior can lead to moral injury and feelings of isolation.

Issues with Current Treatment Approaches

Many current treatment methods, such as antidepressants or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), show limited effectiveness, helping only 40-60% of patients.

      <title>1018-Flex Your Mind_ Techniques for Psychological Strength</title>
      <description>Introduction

Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes discusses psychological flexibility.

Key focus: defining, applying, and identifying strategies for psychological flexibility.

What is Psychological Flexibility?


Acceptance of the present moment: Recognizing and accepting emotions and situations as they are.


Purposeful Action: Making conscious choices that align with personal goals and values.


Reciprocity of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors: Understanding how they influence each other.

Challenges in Implementing Psychological Flexibility


Impact of Trauma: Trauma can make it hard to feel safe and accept the present moment.


Resistance to Change: Often due to fear, lack of energy, or a belief that the current state is safer.

Steps to Foster Psychological Flexibility

Define a Rich and Meaningful Life:

Clarify what a fulfilling life looks like (e.g., relationships, health, hobbies).

Use visual aids like collages to represent goals.


Identify and Nurture Key Relationships:

Prioritize self-care and significant others.

Recognize and address aspects of relationships that cause distress.


Clarify Values:

Determine which values will guide decisions.

Visualize energy allocation like managing a cell phone battery.

Coping Strategies and Behavioral Adjustments


Avoid Energy-Draining Activities:

Unproductive coping mechanisms like avoidance or numbing behaviors.


Focus on Energy-Enhancing Behaviors:

Engage in activities that build toward personal goals and values.

Managing Distress and Negative Emotions


Accept and Sit with Emotions: Acknowledge feelings without judgment and focus on what can be controlled.


Avoiding Cognitive Distortions: Challenge thoughts that are exaggerated or unhelpful.

Practical Applications


Daily Mindfulness: Start the day with intention, focusing on actions that align with goals.


Positive Triggers: Incorporate elements in the environment that promote happiness and well-being.

Implementing Psychological Flexibility

Shortcut Question: Ask, "Are my current thoughts, feelings, and actions moving me closer to or further away from my goals and values?"
Conclusion

Commitment to Purposeful Action: Focus on using energy to move toward goals rather than getting stuck in unproductive behaviors or thoughts.

      <title>1017-Using Your Strengths for PTSD Recovery</title>
      <description>Introduction
Understanding PTSD and CPTSD


Definition of PTSD:

PTSD is a reaction to exposure to a traumatic event that induces extreme horror or trauma.

Commonly seen in military personnel, crime victims, and law enforcement.


Definition of CPTSD:

CPTSD results from repeated exposure to traumatic events where escape is difficult or impossible, causing a sense of helplessness.

Often seen in situations like ongoing abuse, neglect, or professions with repeated trauma exposure (e.g., law enforcement).

Symptoms of PTSD and CPTSD


Re-Experiencing:

Intrusive memories, flashbacks, nightmares, and intense distress when reminded of the trauma.

These symptoms are survival mechanisms, helping the brain stay alert to future threats.


Hypervigilance:

Constantly being on high alert, scanning the environment for threats, leading to physical exhaustion.

Common in those who have experienced trauma, especially if caught unawares in the past.


Physical Symptoms:

Difficulty sleeping, irritability, anger outbursts, feeling jumpy, easily startled, and chronic fatigue.

These symptoms are tied to the body's stress response, which remains on high alert, even in safe situations.


Somatic Complaints:

Physical pain, gastrointestinal issues, and other bodily complaints often tied to chronic stress and hypervigilance.


Interpersonal and Emotional Symptoms:

Persistent difficulties in sustaining relationships, mistrust, betrayal, emotional numbness, and a loss of interest in activities.

Trauma can disrupt the ability to connect with others and maintain healthy relationships.


Cognitive Symptoms:

Difficulty concentrating, dissociative symptoms (feeling detached or losing time), and persistent negative beliefs about oneself.

Trauma affects the ability to focus and may lead to cognitive distortions, such as overgeneralization and catastrophizing.

Interventions and Strategies


Physical Interventions:

Establishing a sleep routine, stress management techniques (e.g., journaling, exercise), and considering medication for sleep if necessary.

Addressing physical symptoms like fatigue by creating a sense of safety and empowerment.


Interpersonal Interventions:

Encouraging connections with non-judgmental, empathetic people, and finding supportive communities, especially those with shared experiences.

Helping individuals communicate their needs and seek out relationships that contribute to their sense of safety and well-being.


Emotional and Cognitive Interventions:

Developing emotional intelligence, understanding the function of emotions, and learning to downregulate stress responses.

Cognitive processing therapy to challenge cognitive distortions and replace them with more balanced thinking.


Environmental Interventions:

Modifying the environment to reduce triggers (e.g., removing reminders of trauma, adding comforting elements).

Creating a safe physical space with tools like safety items, proper lighting, and mirrors to reduce stress.

      <title>1016-Preventing Relapse in Addiction, Anxiety, and Depression</title>
      <description>Introduction
Understanding Relapse


Definition of Relapse:

Relapse is the return to a problematic behavior or symptom that was previously under control or in remission.

It can occur in various contexts, including psychosis, mood disorders, addictions, and chronic pain.


Multi-Dimensional Nature:

Relapse can occur physically (e.g., fatigue, pain), interpersonally (e.g., unhealthy relationships), emotionally, cognitively, environmentally, and spiritually (e.g., loss of meaning).

Warning Signs and Vulnerabilities


Early Signs:

Relapse begins long before the behavior or symptom reappears; early signs may include stress, sleep deficits, nutritional deficiencies, and HPA axis dysregulation.


Vulnerabilities:

Factors like sleep deprivation, poor nutrition, chronic pain, and interpersonal conflicts increase vulnerability to relapse.

Emotional vulnerabilities include dysphoria, anger, grief, and even euphoria (which can lead to overconfidence and neglect of recovery behaviors).

Preventing Physical Relapse


Mindfulness:

Regular self-check-ins are crucial to recognize early signs of relapse and address them before they escalate.

Evening mindfulness helps reflect on the day, acknowledge successes, and learn from challenges.


Healthy Habits:

Maintaining physical health through proper sleep, nutrition, exercise, and medication adherence is vital to prevent relapse.

Avoiding environments or triggers that are linked to past episodes is essential for relapse prevention.

Interpersonal and Emotional Relapse


Interpersonal Dynamics:

Returning to unhealthy relationships or isolating from supportive ones can signal interpersonal relapse.

Emotional relapse may involve negative emotional states like anger or overconfidence, leading to poor decision-making.


Addressing Emotional Triggers:

Identifying and managing triggers for emotional distress (e.g., unresolved anger, anxiety) is key to preventing relapse.

Developing emotional intelligence and distress tolerance skills helps manage emotions more effectively.

Cognitive and Environmental Relapse


Cognitive Distortions:

Cognitive relapse includes unhelpful thinking patterns like all-or-nothing thinking, personalization, and pessimism.

Addressing these thoughts early through cognitive restructuring can prevent a downward spiral.


Environmental Factors:

Reintegrating into environments or situations that triggered past issues (e.g., keeping alcohol at home for someone recovering from alcoholism) can lead to relapse.

It's important to create and maintain a supportive environment that reinforces positive behaviors.

Developing a Relapse Prevention Plan


Daily Mindfulness:

Incorporating mindfulness into daily routines, both in the morning and evening, helps manage vulnerabilities and stay grounded.


Identifying Strengths and Weaknesses:

Reflecting on past relapses can provide insights into what triggered them and how to prevent future ones.

Focusing on strengths and building resilience through positive experiences and realistic goal-setting are key to long-term success.

      <title>1015-Conquering Abandonment Fears_ Expert Tips</title>
      <description>Introduction
Understanding Abandonment and Connection


Human Need for Connection:

Oxytocin drives our need for connection from infancy.

Early dependency on caregivers forms the foundation for future relationship expectations.


Development of Abandonment Fears:


Schemas: Cognitive frameworks developed based on past experiences, influencing how we perceive and react to abandonment.


Beliefs: Early interactions, especially inconsistent caregiving, shape beliefs about others' reliability and our own worth.

Impact of Insecure Attachment


Attachment in Childhood:

Secure attachments provide a buffer against stress and help in developing healthy self-concepts.

Insecure attachments result from neglect, inconsistent caregiving, or trauma, leading to chronic feelings of unsafety and disempowerment.


Behavioral Responses to Abandonment:


Fight or Flight: Children with insecure attachment often remain in a heightened state of anxiety, which continues into adulthood.


Emotional Regulation: Insecurely attached individuals struggle with regulating emotions and often view every stressor as a crisis.

Exploring Abandonment Schemas


Triggers and Reactions:


Common Triggers: Inconsistent caregiving, trauma, introduction of unsafe caregivers, and conditions of worth (e.g., love based on performance).


Emotional Responses: Anger, sadness, shame, and fear of rejection or loss of control.


Questions for Reflection:

Consider what caused abandonment fears in childhood and how these fears manifest in adulthood.

Reflect on whether current reactions are helpful or whether they stem from outdated survival mechanisms.

Addressing and Reprogramming Abandonment Fears


Acknowledging Past Experiences:

Acceptance of past trauma and its impact on current behavior is crucial.

Recognize that past experiences do not have to dictate present and future relationships.


Practical Strategies:


Conscious Decision-Making: Help clients make healthier choices in relationships by understanding their abandonment triggers.


Building Secure Attachments: Develop skills to foster secure relationships, both with oneself and with others.

Attachment Styles and Their Effects


Avoidant Attachment:

Results from harsh or rejecting caregivers, leading to emotional distance and lack of trust in others.


Anxious Attachment:

Stems from inconsistent caregiving, causing fear of being alone and hypervigilance toward potential abandonment.


Ambivalent Attachment:

Characterized by chaotic caregiving, resulting in clinginess and difficulty finding security in relationships.

Creating Secure Attachments


Role of Caregivers:

Consistency, attentiveness, responsiveness, and empathy are key to fostering secure attachments.


CARES Model: Encourages caregivers to be Consistent, Attentive, Responsive, Empathetic, and Supportive.


Self-Care and Self-Compassion:

Learning to provide oneself with the same secure base that a caregiver would offer is essential for emotional resilience.

Challenging Core Abandonment Beliefs


Common Beliefs:

Beliefs such as "all people leave," "I am unlovable," and "I cannot succeed" often underlie abandonment fears.


Reframing Beliefs:

Encourage clients to explore alternate explanations for past rejections and failures and to differentiate past experiences from present realities.

      <title>1014-Secrets of Overcoming Complicated Grief _ Counselor Education</title>
      <description>Introduction
Understanding Grief and Loss

Definitions

Types of Losses

Complicated Grief and Prolonged Grief Disorder


Complicated Grief:

Grief that does not follow a typical pattern and remains unresolved, leading to significant distress and impairment.

The Inventory of Complicated Grief can be used six months after a loss to assess if grief is resolving as expected.


Prolonged Grief Disorder:

Newly added to the DSM-5-TR, applies specifically to grief following the death of a close person.

Symptoms overlap with complicated grief but are strictly related to the death of a person.

Risk Factors for Complicated Mourning


Survivor Characteristics:


Age: Younger individuals may struggle more due to egocentric thinking and difficulty understanding the big picture.


Physical and Mental Health: Chronic pain, mental health issues, and physical reminders of the loss can complicate grief.


Cognitive Understanding: A person’s ability to comprehend the loss and its implications.

Understanding Grief and Loss

Definitions

Types of Losses

Complicated Grief and Prolonged Grief Disorder


Complicated Grief:

Grief that does not follow a typical pattern and remains unresolved, leading to significant distress and impairment.

The Inventory of Complicated Grief can be used six months after a loss to assess if grief is resolving as expected.


Prolonged Grief Disorder:

Newly added to the DSM-5-TR, applies specifically to grief following the death of a close person.

Symptoms overlap with complicated grief but are strictly related to the death of a person.

Risk Factors for Complicated Mourning


Survivor Characteristics:


Age: Younger individuals may struggle more due to egocentric thinking and difficulty understanding the big picture.


Physical and Mental Health: Chronic pain, mental health issues, and physical reminders of the loss can complicate grief.


Cognitive Understanding: A person’s ability to comprehend the loss and its implications.


Personality and Character Traits: Traits like abandonment anxiety, insecure attachment, or codependency can complicate mourning.


Socioeconomic Status: Financial stress can exacerbate grief.


Spiritual Factors: Beliefs about life after death and the meaning of loss.

      <title>1013-Overcoming Emotional Challenges in Porn Addiction Recovery</title>
      <description>Introduction


Presenter: Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes.


Topic: Emotional aspects of porn addiction recovery.


Focus: Interaction of emotions, thoughts, and behaviors; identifying distress triggers; and tools for managing emotions.

Understanding Emotions in Recovery


Emotions as Natural Responses:

Emotions are automatic reactions based on past experiences, similar to a smoke alarm indicating potential threats.

Distressful emotions, if unmanaged, can slow recovery or lead to relapse.


Cognitive Behavioral Triad:


Interaction of Thoughts, Emotions, and Behaviors: Each influences the other, creating a cycle that can either help or hinder recovery.


Feelings Aren't Facts: It’s important to challenge emotions by examining the facts of the situation.

Managing Emotions


Balancing Emotions:

Emotions, whether pleasant or unpleasant, are necessary and natural.

The goal is not to eliminate emotions but to manage them effectively in the context of recovery.


Triggers and Responses:


Memory Pathways: Repeated behaviors reinforce memory pathways, influencing future expectations and reactions.


Self-Fulfilling Prophecies: Negative thoughts can create a cycle of self-sabotage, reinforcing fears and insecurities.

Key Strategies for Emotional Management


Unhooking from Emotions:

Separate yourself from your emotions by recognizing them as temporary states, not as facts or permanent parts of your identity.

Acknowledge feelings like fear or anxiety without letting them dictate your actions.


Distress Tolerance Skills:


Downregulate Stress: Use techniques to calm your body and mind, like mindfulness or physical activities, to prevent relapse.


Addressing Irritability and Anger: Recognize triggers, such as lack of sleep or stress, and manage them proactively.

Dealing with Specific Emotions


Anger and Resentment:

Anger often stems from perceived threats or loss of control. Resentment is prolonged anger that can harm recovery.


Forgiveness: Letting go of anger and resentment is crucial for moving forward. Use the pneumonic "ALL" (Acknowledge, Learn, Live) to process and release anger.


Shame and Guilt:


Shame: A deep-seated belief in being unlovable or defective. It’s important to distinguish between who you are and your behaviors.


Guilt: Anger at oneself for specific actions. Resolving guilt involves self-forgiveness and making amends where necessary.


Depression and Grief:

Depression can result from neurotransmitter imbalances or grief over lost opportunities or relationships.


Acceptance and Moving Forward: Address feelings of hopelessness by focusing on what can be controlled and accepting what cannot.

Building Resilience in Recovery


Hardiness and Tragic Optimism:


Tragic Optimism: Acknowledge the bad but also recognize the good, fostering hope for positive change.


Hardiness: Involves commitment to meaningful life goals, control over what can be managed, and viewing challenges as opportunities for growth.

Conclusion


Emotions as Communication:

Emotions signal potential threats or positive experiences based on past knowledge.

Effective recovery requires addressing emotions, thoughts, and behaviors together to create a balanced and sustainable recovery process.

      <title>1012-Understanding &amp; Managing Narcissistic Traits in Yourself and Others</title>
      <description>Introduction
Understanding Narcissism


Narcissistic Personality Disorder:

Defined by enduring patterns in cognition, emotional responses, interpersonal functioning, and impulse control.

Must be pervasive, stable, and present since adolescence, causing significant impairment in important life areas.

Diagnosis requires at least five traits, including grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy.


Narcissistic Behaviors:

Not indicative of the disorder but reflect certain attitudes and behaviors that exist on a continuum from healthy to unhealthy.

Can manifest in specific settings or situations and are influenced by cultural norms and personal experiences.

Causes and Functions of Narcissistic Behaviors


Skill Deficits:

Low emotional intelligence, poor assertiveness, or communication skills can lead to narcissistic behaviors.

Learned behaviors for self-protection, often developed in response to past trauma or environments where survival required self-centeredness.


Perception and Interpretation:

People with insecure attachment, weak self-esteem, or high rejection sensitivity may misinterpret others' actions as narcissistic.

Hypervigilance from past abuse can cause overreactions to benign behaviors.

Common Narcissistic Behaviors and Their Roots


Self-Centeredness:

Often arises from childhood environments where one was made responsible for others' emotions and well-being.

Behaviors like believing others need them or that they can succeed alone are rooted in a need for control and safety.


Daydreams of Grandiosity:

Daydreaming about unrealistic success or recognition can be a sign of unhealthy narcissism when it becomes a substitute for actual achievement.

Persistent fantasies of power or beauty can hinder real-life progress and relationships.


Sense of Specialness:

Believing oneself to be unique and only associating with high-status individuals reflects an inflated sense of self-importance.

Can lead to refusing entry-level jobs or being highly judgmental of others, driven by fear of rejection or low self-esteem.


Admiration and Rejection Sensitivity:

Craving admiration and being hypersensitive to criticism can stem from unstable self-worth and insecure attachment.

Such individuals may actively seek out opportunities to showcase their superiority and react poorly when not receiving expected praise.

Addressing Narcissistic Behaviors


Developing Self-Awareness:

Recognizing and reflecting on behaviors that communicate self-importance or entitlement is crucial.

Understanding the origins of these behaviors, whether from cultural influences or past traumas, helps in modifying them.


Communication and Relationships:

Effective communication is key to ensuring needs are met in relationships without resorting to narcissistic behaviors.

Setting boundaries and addressing the root causes of narcissistic traits can improve interpersonal dynamics.


Practical Strategies:

Engage in self-reflection to identify narcissistic tendencies and their impact on others.

Seek feedback and practice empathy by considering others' perspectives.

Foster secure attachments and healthy self-esteem to reduce the need for external validation and superiority.

      <itunes:summary>Introduction
Understanding Narcissism


Narcissistic Personality Disorder:

Defined by enduring patterns in cognition, emotional responses, interpersonal functioning, and impulse control.

Must be pervasive, stable, and present since adolescence, causing significant impairment in important life areas.

Diagnosis requires at least five traits, including grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy.


Narcissistic Behaviors:

Not indicative of the disorder but reflect certain attitudes and behaviors that exist on a continuum from healthy to unhealthy.

Can manifest in specific settings or situations and are influenced by cultural norms and personal experiences.

Causes and Functions of Narcissistic Behaviors


Skill Deficits:

Low emotional intelligence, poor assertiveness, or communication skills can lead to narcissistic behaviors.

Learned behaviors for self-protection, often developed in response to past trauma or environments where survival required self-centeredness.


Perception and Interpretation:

People with insecure attachment, weak self-esteem, or high rejection sensitivity may misinterpret others' actions as narcissistic.

Hypervigilance from past abuse can cause overreactions to benign behaviors.

Common Narcissistic Behaviors and Their Roots


Self-Centeredness:

Often arises from childhood environments where one was made responsible for others' emotions and well-being.

Behaviors like believing others need them or that they can succeed alone are rooted in a need for control and safety.


Daydreams of Grandiosity:

Daydreaming about unrealistic success or recognition can be a sign of unhealthy narcissism when it becomes a substitute for actual achievement.

Persistent fantasies of power or beauty can hinder real-life progress and relationships.


Sense of Specialness:

Believing oneself to be unique and only associating with high-status individuals reflects an inflated sense of self-importance.

Can lead to refusing entry-level jobs or being highly judgmental of others, driven by fear of rejection or low self-esteem.


Admiration and Rejection Sensitivity:

Craving admiration and being hypersensitive to criticism can stem from unstable self-worth and insecure attachment.

Such individuals may actively seek out opportunities to showcase their superiority and react poorly when not receiving expected praise.

Addressing Narcissistic Behaviors


Developing Self-Awareness:

Recognizing and reflecting on behaviors that communicate self-importance or entitlement is crucial.

Understanding the origins of these behaviors, whether from cultural influences or past traumas, helps in modifying them.


Communication and Relationships:

Effective communication is key to ensuring needs are met in relationships without resorting to narcissistic behaviors.

Setting boundaries and addressing the root causes of narcissistic traits can improve interpersonal dynamics.


Practical Strategies:

Engage in self-reflection to identify narcissistic tendencies and their impact on others.

Seek feedback and practice empathy by considering others' perspectives.

Foster secure attachments and healthy self-esteem to reduce the need for external validation and superiority.

      <title>1011-Preventing Misdiagnosis in Counseling _ Holistic Health</title>
      <description>Introduction
Differential Diagnosis Overview


Symptom Overlap: Many symptoms, like fatigue, can have multiple causes (e.g., hormonal imbalances, medication side effects, nutrient deficiencies).


Comprehensive Approach: Importance of considering bio-psycho-social factors before diagnosing to avoid missing underlying physical causes.


Talk Therapy Limitations: Emphasizes that some conditions (e.g., atrial fibrillation) cannot be resolved through therapy alone.

Framing Bias in Diagnosis


Definition: A cognitive bias where decision-making is influenced by how information is presented.


Impact: Patients may describe symptoms differently to different professionals (e.g., physical symptoms to doctors, emotional symptoms to therapists), leading to potential misdiagnoses.

Confirmation Bias


Definition: The tendency to favor information that confirms pre-existing beliefs or expectations.


Clinical Implications: Can lead to misdiagnoses by assuming a patient’s issues are solely mental health-related without considering physiological causes.

Availability Heuristic


Definition: A mental shortcut where people rely on immediate examples that come to mind.


Example: Increased diagnoses of personality disorders due to media coverage, potentially leading to over-diagnosis.

Importance of Comprehensive Evaluation


Holistic Approach: Evaluate all aspects of a patient's life (physical, emotional, cognitive, etc.) to determine the root cause of symptoms.


Avoiding Over-Diagnosis: Caution against diagnosing multiple disorders when symptoms might be better explained by a single condition (e.g., CPTSD).

Physiological Causes of Depression


Hormonal Imbalances: Low testosterone, estrogen, thyroid issues.


Nutrient Deficiencies: Low vitamin D, iron deficiency, dehydration.


Sleep Disorders: Sleep apnea, circadian rhythm disruptions.


Other Physical Factors: Chronic inflammation, medication side effects, cardiovascular dysfunction, addiction.

Low Energy and Motivation


Causes: Chronic fatigue syndrome, sleep disturbances, medication side effects, hormonal imbalances, and chronic stress.


Emotional and Cognitive Factors: Depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, PTSD, and cognitive distortions like hopelessness and helplessness.

Sleep Disturbances


Contributors: Sleep apnea, hormonal imbalances, hypervigilance (especially in PTSD/CPTSD), addiction, medication side effects.


Impact on Mental Health: Poor sleep exacerbates issues like low energy, depression, and anxiety.

Attention and Concentration Difficulties


Physical Causes: Blood sugar issues, dehydration, cardiovascular disease, thyroid imbalances.


Cognitive and Emotional Factors: ADD/ADHD, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia.

Social Withdrawal and Isolation


Oxytocin Role: Low levels or ineffective response to oxytocin can lead to social withdrawal.


Mental Health Connections: Common in schizophrenia, autism, anxiety, and depression.

Anxiety and Worry


Nutritional Deficiencies: Imbalances in magnesium, vitamin D, and B vitamins.


Other Causes: Hormonal imbalances, sleep dysfunction, side effects of medications like benzodiazepines and antidepressants.


Addiction: Stress from hiding addiction or withdrawal symptoms can exacerbate anxiety.

      <title>1010-Practical Tools to Support Those with Psychosis _ Counselor Training</title>
      <description>1. Introduction
2. Understanding Psychotic Symptoms


Symptoms Defined: Psychotic symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized behavior, and speech.


Associated Disorders:

3. Causes of Psychotic Symptoms


Breakthrough Symptoms: These can occur even in individuals who are generally functional.


Causes:


Unmedicated State: By choice or due to forgetfulness.


Medication Non-compliance: Due to side effects or difficulty maintaining a regimen.


Stress: A major trigger for acute episodes.


Medication Imbalances: Can be caused by dehydration, heat, dietary changes, weight fluctuations, and drug interactions (e.g., antibiotics, caffeine, nicotine).


Other Factors: Conditions like hypoglycemia, severe sleep deprivation, and chronic stress can exacerbate symptoms.

4. Strategies for Support


Medication Management: Ensuring compliance and adjusting for lifestyle changes.


Stress Reduction:

Identify stressors (physical, cognitive, emotional) and work to mitigate them.

Develop emergency plans to address prodromal symptoms (early signs of relapse).


Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Psychosis:

Typically more effective during remission than in acute episodes.

Focuses on reducing symptoms, distress, and interference with quality of life.

Techniques include relaxation training, graded exposure, scaffolding, and activity scheduling.


Environmental Modifications: Adjusting surroundings to minimize stressors and support daily functioning.

5. Recognizing and Managing Prodromal Symptoms


Prodromal Symptoms:

Chronic anxiety, mood swings, sleep disturbances, memory problems, social withdrawal, decline in hygiene, and inability to perform daily tasks.


Early Intervention: Recognizing these signs allows for early intervention to prevent full-blown episodes.

6. Addressing Hallucinations and Delusions


Safety and Reality Testing:

Initially, join the individual in their reality to establish safety.

Avoid arguing or reasoning with delusional beliefs during acute episodes.

Use CBT techniques to challenge and reframe delusions during remission.


Behavioral Strategies: Encourage comparison of their behavior to others, use of distraction techniques, and reinforcing positive behaviors.

7. Enhancing Functionality


Daily Living Support: Use lists, schedules, and guides to help individuals manage daily tasks.


Token Economies: Reward systems to encourage participation in therapeutic activities.


Environmental Prompts: Reminders and tools to support memory and task completion.

8. Cognitive and Executive Functioning


Support Strategies:

Break tasks into smaller components (chunking).

Minimize distractions and create structured environments.

Roleplay problem-solving scenarios.

Use alarms and reminders for medication and daily tasks.


Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): Applied during remission or prodromal phases to manage residual symptoms and improve quality of life.

9. Final Considerations


Relapse Prevention:

Continuous monitoring of stress levels and medication effectiveness.

Developing a strong support system and improving stress management skills.


Therapeutic Engagement: Ensuring clients feel safe and validated in discussing their symptoms.

10. Conclusion

Further Resources: Dr. Snipes mentions an upcoming on-demand class for more in-depth learning about CBT for psychosis.

<strong>Other Factors</strong>: Conditions like hypoglycemia, severe sleep deprivation, and chronic stress can exacerbate symptoms.</li>
</ul><p><strong>4. Strategies for Support</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Medication Management</strong>: Ensuring compliance and adjusting for lifestyle changes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Stress Reduction</strong>:</li>
<li class="ql-indent-1">Identify stressors (physical, cognitive, emotional) and work to mitigate them.</li>
<li class="ql-indent-1">Develop emergency plans to address prodromal symptoms (early signs of relapse).</li>
<li>
<strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Psychosis</strong>:</li>
<li class="ql-indent-1">Typically more effective during remission than in acute episodes.</li>
<li class="ql-indent-1">Focuses on reducing symptoms, distress, and interference with quality of life.</li>

Topic: Screening in Behavioral Health

Presenter: Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes

Focus: Understanding the purpose, instrument selection, and information gathering in the screening process.

2. Definition and Purpose of Screening


Screening Defined: A process to review current situations, symptoms, and collateral information to assess the probability of a problem.


Key Points:

Screening is not a diagnosis.

Can be performed by various professionals, including HR officers, pastors, nurses, doctors, and pharmacists.


Purpose:

Determine eligibility and appropriateness for services.

Assess immediacy of need (e.g., detoxification for substance abuse).

3. Transparency and Informed Consent


Importance of Transparency: Clients must understand the screening process.


Informed Consent: Verbal consent is required before conducting a screening.

4. Screening Process


Engagement: Screening is the first opportunity to engage the person in the therapeutic process.


Types of Screening:


Physical and Mental Health: Screening for issues like diabetes, skin cancer, depression, etc.


Risk and Safety: Assessing the risk of harm to self or others.

5. Screening Tools and Techniques


Screening Instruments: Various tools available, such as CAGE for alcohol use, and others for mental health and substance abuse.


Observation: Non-verbal cues and physical signs (e.g., intoxication, withdrawal) are crucial.


Interviewing: Direct questions to the client or significant others for additional context.

6. Importance of Multi-Disciplinary Collaboration


Collaboration Across Professions: Ensures comprehensive care by involving multiple professionals (e.g., doctors, counselors).


Referral to Specialists: If screening indicates a need for further evaluation, referrals are made to appropriate specialists.

7. Cultural and Socioeconomic Sensitivity


Considerations: Screenings should be sensitive to cultural, socioeconomic, gender, and other personal factors.


Customizing the Approach: Tailor the screening environment and process to the individual's background and needs.

8. Addressing Stigma


Stigma Awareness: Acknowledge and address any stigma associated with mental health, substance use, or seeking help.


Cultural Beliefs: Work within the client's cultural context to reduce stigma and promote engagement.

9. Screening as an Ongoing Process


Continuous Engagement: Screening is not a one-time event but part of ongoing assessment and engagement.


Use of Ancillary Information: Gathering additional information from multiple sources to support screening conclusions.

10. Practical Considerations in Screening


First Impressions: Professional presentation, punctuality, and courtesy are essential in the initial screening.


Environmental Factors: Ensure the screening environment is welcoming, calm, and sensitive to the client’s needs.


Client Empowerment: Involve the client in decision-making and ensure they feel respected and heard.

11. Screening Outcomes and Next Steps

      <title>1008-Addiction Prevalence, Symptoms &amp; Course | Addiction Counselor Academy</title>
      <description>1. Introduction

Topic: Addiction Prevalence, Symptoms, and Course

Presenter: Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes

Focus: Understanding addiction as a chronic disease affecting brain function and behavior.

2. Prevalence of Addiction


2012 Statistics:

6.5% of the population over age 12 reported heavy drinking.

9.2% reported illicit drug use.


2021 Statistics:

14.3% reported illicit drug use, possibly influenced by marijuana legalization.

5.8% reported heavy drinking, showing a slight decrease.


Interpretation: The statistics provide insight but may be influenced by changing legal statuses of substances like marijuana.

3. Addiction as a Disease


Definition: Addiction is a chronic disease that impacts brain reward, motivation, and memory circuits.


Diagnosis: The DSM-5 categorizes substance-related disorders into intoxication, withdrawal, and substance use disorders.


Impact on the Brain: Addiction causes physiological changes, particularly in dopamine and opioid systems, leading to altered brain function and behavior.

4. Understanding Substance Use Disorder (SUD)


Categories: Intoxication, withdrawal, and substance use disorder.


Symptoms of SUD:

Tolerance

Withdrawal symptoms

Cravings

Repeated unsuccessful attempts to quit

Excessive time spent on substance-related activities

Reduction in other activities

Continued use despite harm

Use in risky situations

Social or relationship problems


Severity Levels:


Mild: 2-3 symptoms


Moderate: 4-5 symptoms


Severe: 6 or more symptoms

5. Addiction Progression


Chronic Nature: Addiction is progressive and can lead to severe disability or premature death if untreated.


Physiological Course: Repeated substance use causes surges in brain chemicals, leading to tolerance and dependence.


Relapse Potential: Even after treatment, cravings can persist, particularly during early and sustained remission.

6. Types of Addictions


Chemical Addictions: Alcohol, drugs, etc.


Behavioral Addictions: Gambling, internet use, sex, shopping, etc.


Process Addictions: Non-substance-related activities that trigger similar brain responses as drugs.

7. Treatment and Recovery


Treatment Planning: Depends on the severity, types of addiction, symptoms, and individual resources.


Considerations: Age, cognitive functioning, physical and mental health conditions, and availability of resources.


Chronic Management: Recovery involves continuous management of addiction, addressing underlying issues, and rebuilding brain function.

8. Psychological and Physical Dependence


Physical Dependence: Involves neurological changes that require the substance for normal functioning.


Psychological Dependence: Results from mood effects due to neurochemical imbalances and stress responses.

9. Concurrent Disorders


Co-occurring Issues: Depression, anxiety, trauma, and other mental health conditions often accompany addiction.


Importance of Comprehensive Care: Addressing all co-occurring disorders is crucial for effective recovery.

10. Future Directions


Next Session: Focus on models and theories of addiction.


Understanding Addiction: Continued exploration of addiction as a complex, multifaceted disease requiring a comprehensive approach to treatment.

      <title>1007-Unleashing the power of rapport_ Transform your therapy sessions</title>
      <description>1. Introduction
2. Understanding Secure Attachment

Definition: Secure attachment involves feeling safe, being authentic, and vulnerable without fear of judgment or abandonment.

Relevance: Attachment trauma often underlies addiction and mental health issues.

Application: Creating a secure attachment in therapy allows clients to open up and be authentic.

3. Importance of Rapport

Definition: Rapport is the sense of safety, connection, and trustworthiness between clinician and client.

Impact: Lack of rapport can skew assessment results and hinder effective treatment.

Goal: Develop rapport from the first meeting by showing genuine interest and care for the client.

4. Key Components of Secure Attachment Behaviors in Therapy


Consistency: Be consistent in presence and behavior within and between sessions.


Acceptance: Show unconditional positive regard, valuing clients as individuals regardless of their behaviors or opinions.


Responsiveness: Respond to clients' emotions, questions, and problems; demonstrate active listening and engagement.


Empathy: Provide empathy with limited self-disclosure; focus on understanding clients from their perspective.


Safety: Create a safe and supportive environment where clients feel comfortable expressing their true selves.

5. Practical Strategies for Building Rapport


Consistency in Behavior: Avoid distractions like checking phones; maintain consistent non-verbal communication.


Acceptance and Positive Regard: Be mindful of non-verbal cues and communicate acceptance, even when you disagree.


Responsiveness to Emotions and Questions: Engage in Socratic questioning and respond appropriately to clients' emotional cues.


Empathy with Limited Self-Disclosure: Use self-disclosure sparingly to build rapport without shifting focus from the client.


Creating a Safe Environment: Encourage open discussion about what helps clients feel safe and comfortable in therapy.

6. Addressing Resistance and Communication Issues


Understanding Resistance: Resistance is not oppositional behavior; it's a form of communication that needs to be understood.


Behavior as Communication: Explore the meaning behind behaviors, especially when clients are not following through with treatment suggestions.


Empowerment Through Collaboration: Involve clients in setting goals and treatment plans to create a win-win scenario.

7. Communication Techniques


Active Listening: Reflect both verbal and non-verbal communication from clients to ensure understanding.


Clarification and Summarization: Periodically summarize and clarify clients’ statements to maintain understanding and focus.


Open-ended Questions: Use open-ended questions to encourage deeper discussion rather than simple yes/no answers.

8. Non-Verbal Communication


Awareness of Non-Verbal Cues: Monitor clients' body language, facial expressions, and other non-verbal cues to gauge comfort and engagement.


Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences in non-verbal communication, such as eye contact.

9. Maintaining and Adjusting Rapport


Continuous Rapport Building: Rapport is not only built in the first session but must be maintained throughout the therapeutic relationship.


Reflecting on Past Experiences: Learn from previous client interactions to improve rapport in future sessions.

      <title>1005-Uncovering Pornography's Impact_ The Good and the Bad</title>
      <description>1. Introduction to Pornography

2. Prevalence of Pornography Use


Statistics:

High prevalence of pornography use among both men and women, with significant weekly usage.

Noted increase in pornography use among older adults (ages 50-77).

Impact of Stigma:

Stigmatizing pornography use can lead to secrecy, shame, and potential mental health issues.

3. Reasons for Pornography Use


Common Motivations:

Curiosity, sexual education, social enhancement, peer pressure, and sexual arousal.

Pornography can also serve as a medium for exploring sexuality and managing mood.

Sexual Enhancement:

Some use pornography to generate new sexual fantasies or to manage sexual tension.

It provides anonymity, convenience, and safety in exploring sexual desires.

4. Positive Impacts of Pornography


Exploration and Relief:

Facilitates exploration of personal sexuality in a private and non-judgmental setting.

Provides a less risky outlet for sexual release compared to real-life hookups.

Neurochemical Effects:

Triggers the release of dopamine, oxytocin, and other chemicals that can enhance mood and reduce stress.

5. Negative Impacts of Pornography


Physical and Hormonal Changes:

Overuse of pornography can lead to neurotoxic effects, reducing brain density and causing hormonal imbalances.

Disruption of the HPA axis, leading to emotional dysregulation and neurotransmitter imbalances.

Impact on Sleep and Health:

Pornography overuse can impair sleep quality and contribute to chronic stress and inflammation.

6. Interpersonal Aspects of Pornography


Positive Aspects:

Can build trust and reduce fear of rejection in relationships by facilitating open discussions about sexual preferences.

May enhance sexual satisfaction and support monogamy in certain situations.

Negative Aspects:

Can lead to guilt, anxiety, emotional distancing, and lower relationship satisfaction if not openly communicated between partners.

May contribute to attachment issues, fear of rejection, and unrealistic sexual expectations.

7. Impact on Self-Esteem and Body Image


Negative Effects:

Pornography use can negatively impact both the user’s and their partner’s self-esteem and body image.

May perpetuate unrealistic expectations about sexual interactions and contribute to the objectification of others.

8. Cognitive and Emotional Impacts


Positive Cognitive Effects:

Allows individuals to refine their sexual schema and challenge pre-existing attitudes.

Negative Cognitive Effects:

Can lead to cognitive distortions such as all-or-nothing thinking, jumping to conclusions, and overgeneralization.

Emotional Effects:

While pornography can temporarily relieve stress, it may also increase feelings of loneliness, detachment, and reduced emotional intimacy.

9. Conclusion: Addressing Pornography Use


Healthy Management:

Emphasizes the importance of open dialogue about pornography use to reduce stigma, shame, and secrecy.

Recognizes that while some individuals may use pornography without ill effects, others may quickly develop problematic patterns.

Advocates for understanding and addressing the potential negative impacts of pornography within the context of relationships and personal well-being.

      <title>1001-How Endurance can Improve Your Marriage _ Pastoral Counseling Series</title>
      <description>Here is a structured bullet-point summary of the video titled "Restoring Your Marriage with God: Developing Endurance" presented by Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes:

---

Introduction


Presenter: Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes


Topic: Developing endurance in marriage, guided by biblical principles.


Key Idea: Marriage involves enduring both good and bad times, as reflected in traditional wedding vows.

Understanding Endurance


Definition: Endurance is the courage to face and overcome difficult situations, motivated by hope for improvement.

Biblical Basis:


Romans 5:3-4: Suffering leads to endurance, which builds character and hope.


James 1:12: Endurance through trials results in the Crown of Life from God.

Endurance in Personal Responsibility

Admitting Mistakes:

It's often easier to endure others' faults than to acknowledge and face consequences for our own.


Example: Recognizing personal faults and enduring correction, as advised in Proverbs 15:32.

Biblical Examples of Endurance

Enduring Personal Mistakes:


Adam and Eve: Expelled from Eden after disobeying God.


Noah: Endured the flood and later faced consequences for getting drunk.


Other Figures: Abraham, Aaron, the Israelites, Moses, Jonah, David—each faced and endured the consequences of their actions.

Enduring Others’ Mistakes:


Jacob: Tricked into marrying Leah instead of Rachel.


Joseph: Endured slavery and false accusations.


Other Figures: Moses, Ruth, Naomi, Job, and David all endured hardships caused by others' actions.

Applying Endurance in Marriage

Self-Reflection:

Reflect on personal experiences where endurance was necessary (e.g., parenting, personal growth).

Identify risks needed to repair a marriage, such as speaking the truth or rebuilding trust.

Motivational Enhancement:

Focus on long-term benefits of enduring and working on relationships.

Increase motivation by recognizing small achievements and progress.

Practical Tools for Endurance

Distress Tolerance:


MAD Technique: Be Mindful, Accept feelings, Down-regulate stress.


Dialectics: Embrace both the good and bad aspects of life and relationships.


Tragic Optimism: Acknowledge difficulties while maintaining hope for improvement.

Handling Resistance in Counseling:

Explore reasons behind resistance to change.

Ensure both partners understand the purpose and benefits of suggested changes.

Additional Considerations

Commitment, Control, Challenge (Heartiness):


Commitment: Review what's important in life and allocate energy accordingly.


Control: Identify aspects of life where control is possible and make plans to manage them.


Challenge: View obstacles as challenges to overcome rather than insurmountable barriers.

Repairing Attachment:


C.A.R.E.S. Mnemonic: Focus on Consistent mindfulness, Attention, Response, Empathy, and Support.

Rebuild trust and faith in one another through enduring commitment and small steps of progress.

Conclusion


Endurance in Recovery: Essential for the success of counseling and improving relationships.


Biblical Insight: Resistance is a sign of fear or lack of tools to change; seek strength in faith, as exemplified by Jonah's prayer in distress.

Introduction


Presenter: Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes


Topic: Developing endurance in marriage, guided by biblical principles.


Key Idea: Marriage involves enduring both good and bad times, as reflected in traditional wedding vows.

Understanding Endurance


Definition: Endurance is the courage to face and overcome difficult situations, motivated by hope for improvement.

Biblical Basis:


Romans 5:3-4: Suffering leads to endurance, which builds character and hope.


James 1:12: Endurance through trials results in the Crown of Life from God.

Endurance in Personal Responsibility

Admitting Mistakes:

It's often easier to endure others' faults than to acknowledge and face consequences for our own.


Example: Recognizing personal faults and enduring correction, as advised in Proverbs 15:32.

Biblical Examples of Endurance

Enduring Personal Mistakes:


Adam and Eve: Expelled from Eden after disobeying God.


Noah: Endured the flood and later faced consequences for getting drunk.


Other Figures: Abraham, Aaron, the Israelites, Moses, Jonah, David—each faced and endured the consequences of their actions.

Enduring Others’ Mistakes:


Jacob: Tricked into marrying Leah instead of Rachel.


Joseph: Endured slavery and false accusations.


Other Figures: Moses, Ruth, Naomi, Job, and David all endured hardships caused by others' actions.

Applying Endurance in Marriage

Self-Reflection:

Reflect on personal experiences where endurance was necessary (e.g., parenting, personal growth).

Identify risks needed to repair a marriage, such as speaking the truth or rebuilding trust.

Motivational Enhancement:

Focus on long-term benefits of enduring and working on relationships.

Increase motivation by recognizing small achievements and progress.

Practical Tools for Endurance

Distress Tolerance:


MAD Technique: Be Mindful, Accept feelings, Down-regulate stress.


Dialectics: Embrace both the good and bad aspects of life and relationships.


Tragic Optimism: Acknowledge difficulties while maintaining hope for improvement.

Handling Resistance in Counseling:

Explore reasons behind resistance to change.

Ensure both partners understand the purpose and benefits of suggested changes.

Additional Considerations

Commitment, Control, Challenge (Heartiness):


Commitment: Review what's important in life and allocate energy accordingly.


Control: Identify aspects of life where control is possible and make plans to manage them.


Challenge: View obstacles as challenges to overcome rather than insurmountable barriers.

Repairing Attachment:


C.A.R.E.S. Mnemonic: Focus on Consistent mindfulness, Attention, Response, Empathy, and Support.

Rebuild trust and faith in one another through enduring commitment and small steps of progress.

Conclusion


Endurance in Recovery: Essential for the success of counseling and improving relationships.


Biblical Insight: Resistance is a sign of fear or lack of tools to change; seek strength in faith, as exemplified by Jonah's prayer in distress.

      <title>1000-Secrets of Effective Treatment Planning &amp; Reassessment</title>
      <description>### Treatment Planning
- **Importance**: Many clinicians and interns struggle with writing effective treatment plans.
- **Tools**:
 - **Integrative Summary**: Provides an executive summary of the patient's story, supports diagnosis, and identifies problems to drive treatment planning.
 - **Standardized Instruments**: Used for guiding treatment planning, such as FARS, CANS, ASAM, and LOCUS.
  
### Integrated Summary
- **Purpose**: Summarizes the patient’s condition, diagnosis, and impacts of identified problems.
- **Use**: Drives treatment planning by connecting symptoms to the diagnosis and planning interventions.
- **Key Components**:
 - Summarize presenting problems and evidence of impairments.
 - Define the diagnosis and support it with evidence.
 - Provide treatment recommendations.
 - Include a relapse prevention plan.

### Reassessment
- **Purpose**: Evaluate patient progress, note any changes in their condition, and adjust treatment plans as needed.
- **Frequency**: Recommended to be done at least monthly to ensure up-to-date care.
- **Components**:
 - Reassess the patient’s current status.
 - Evaluate progress on goals and identify new challenges or strengths.
 - Adjust treatment plan accordingly.

### Standardized Instruments
- **FARS (Functional Assessment Rating Scale)**:
 - Evaluates various symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and cognitive performance.
 - Helps in tracking progress by rating symptoms at regular intervals.
- **CANS (Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths)**:
 - Focused on trauma and development issues in children and adolescents.
 - Considers family, developmental needs, trauma, and substance use.
- **LOCUS (Level of Care Utilization System)**:
 - Assesses risk of harm, functional status, and recovery environment.
 - Used often with clients to determine the appropriate level of care.
- **ASAM (American Society of Addiction Medicine Criteria)**:
 - Measures the need for treatment in six dimensions, including substance use and biomedical conditions.
 - Broad and effective for evaluating comprehensive needs.

### Effective Treatment Planning
- **Goals**: Set measurable and achievable targets.
- **Client Involvement**: Engage the client in the planning process to ensure motivation and adherence.
- **Reassessment**: Conduct frequent reassessments to monitor progress, identify obstacles, and adjust plans as needed.

### Common Pitfalls in Treatment Planning
- **Lack of Measurable Goals**: Goals should be specific and measurable.
- **Insufficient Client Feedback**: Clients should be involved in their treatment planning process to ensure they are motivated and invested.
- **Failure to Reassess Frequently**: Regular reassessments are critical to adjusting treatment plans and maintaining client motivation.

### Time-Effective Strategies
- **Client Participation**: Involving clients in the treatment planning and documentation process.
- **Use of Worksheets**: Clients fill out treatment planning worksheets at home, focusing on what's important to them and identifying problems.

### Conclusion
- **Empowerment**: When clients participate in the treatment planning process, they are more empowered and motivated.
- **Concurrent Documentation**: Involving clients in documentation during sessions can improve their engagement and understanding of the treatment process.

      <title>999-Understanding Triggers and Cravings: Counselor Education Webinar</title>
      <description>### Summary

#### Introduction
- Presenter: Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes
- Topic: Understanding triggers and cravings
- Goals: Define triggers and cravings, identify personal triggers, and discuss coping methods

#### Defining Triggers and Cravings
- **Triggers**: Anything prompting a rewarding or survival response.
 - Examples: Touch (hot stove), sounds (alarm clock), sights (child's smile), smells (fall air), places (dentist's office), people (reminding you of someone), situations (new job).
- **Cravings**: Repetitive, consuming thoughts or desires caused by triggers.
 - Example: Food commercials triggering hunger at night.

#### Components of Triggers
1. **Sensory Awareness**:
  - Body perceives a stimulus and sends it to the brain.
  - Brain retrieves a schema to interpret and respond to the stimulus.
  - Neurochemical release depending on the schema (fight or flight, pleasure).

2. **Cognitive Awareness**:
  - Includes flashbacks and intrusive thoughts.
  - Brain determines how to handle the situation based on past experiences.

3. **Systemic Awareness**:
  - Body notices imbalances (blood sugar, dopamine levels).
  - Brain looks for past coping mechanisms to address the imbalance.

#### Coping with Triggers and Cravings
1. **Identify Personal Triggers**:
  - Recognize triggers for specific feelings, thoughts, and behaviors.
  - Example: Hunger, tiredness, environmental factors (places, times of day).

2. **Developing Awareness**:
  - Be mindful of surroundings and internal states.
  - Journal recent triggers and analyze early warning signs.

3. **Increase Positive Triggers**:
  - Enhance the environment with positive stimuli (pictures, smells, music).

4. **Addressing Negative Triggers**:
  - Reduce or manage negative triggers (broken locks, unsafe situations).
  - Use coping strategies like deep breathing, meditation, exercise.

#### Practical Strategies
1. **Four Square Breathing**: 
  - Trigger relaxation response by deep breathing.

2. **Loving Kindness Meditation**:
  - Reduce stress response by fostering positive emotions.

3. **Increase Physical Safety**:
  - Modify environment to reduce stress (mirrors, locked doors).

4. **Address Comfort and Ergonomics**:
  - Improve physical comfort to enhance mood and focus.

5. **Build Positive Relationships**:
  - Use assertive communication and manage boundaries to feel secure.

6. **Recondition Responses**:
  - Change associations with negative triggers (e.g., payday as positive).
  - Make triggers more unpleasant if necessary (e.g., Antabuse for alcohol).

7. **Mindfulness and Journaling**:
  - Reflect on triggers and responses to understand and manage them better.

#### Handling Cravings
1. **Stop, Look, Listen, and Feel**:
  - Recognize cravings as clues to unmet needs.

2. **Alternative Actions**:
  - Identify what is truly needed and find healthier ways to fulfill that need.

3. **Dealing with Persistent Cravings**:
  - Understand cravings as similar to a child's tantrum; resisting strengthens resolve.

      <title>998-Improve Your Listening Skills: Breaking the Cycle of Defensiveness</title>
      <description>### Summary

#### Introduction
- Presenter: Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes
- Topic: Listening without defensiveness
- Goals: Understanding causes of defensiveness, enhancing assertiveness, and reducing defensiveness

#### Understanding Defensiveness
- **Defensiveness**: Indicates a lack of safety; behavior or feeling when feeling unsafe.
- **Causes**:
 - Prior negative experiences (verbal/physical aggression, invalidation).
 - Low self-esteem leading to fear of rejection.
 - Triggering topics related to trauma or powerlessness.

#### Creating Safety
1. **Recognize Emotional State**:
  - Defensiveness arises from feeling unsafe or powerless.
  - Brain prioritizes fight or flight over processing information.

2. **Criticism vs. Behavior**:
  - Separate criticism of behavior from criticism of self.
  - Understand that feedback is about actions, not personal worth.

3. **Constructive Feedback**:
  - Take useful parts of feedback and leave the rest.
  - Consider the intention behind feedback; if it's aggressive, set boundaries.

#### Enhancing Communication
1. **Realistic Expectations**:
  - Not everyone will like you or your actions.
  - Nurture multiple sources of support.

2. **Set and Maintain Boundaries**:
  - Physical, emotional, and cognitive boundaries.
  - Communicate discomfort and establish respectful interactions.

3. **Self-Esteem**:
  - Confidence reduces defensiveness.
  - Respect differing opinions without feeling threatened.

#### Strategies to Reduce Defensiveness
1. **Empathy and Curiosity**:
  - Understand differing perspectives.
  - Explore underlying reasons behind others' views.

2. **Manage Reactions**:
  - Reflect and ground yourself when feeling defensive.
  - Validate others' experiences without agreeing.

3. **Objective Language**:
  - Use "I" statements to express feelings without blame.
  - Avoid vague or accusatory language.

#### Practical Steps
1. **Ground Rules**:
  - Establish clear boundaries for interactions.
  - Ensure safe environments for discussions.

2. **Avoid Mind Reading**:
  - Don't assume intentions behind others' words.
  - Focus on one issue at a time during conflicts.

3. **Rehearse and Prepare**:
  - Practice conversations to build confidence.
  - Identify triggers and prepare responses.

4. **Apologize When Necessary**:
  - Acknowledge mistakes to build trust and reduce defensiveness.

5. **Collaborative Solutions**:
  - Work towards win-win outcomes.
  - Respectfully disagree and find common ground.

- Goals: Understanding guilt and shame, their causes, effects, and ways to overcome them

#### Definitions and Differences
- **Guilt**: Anger at oneself for a behavior; feeling you did something wrong.
- **Shame**: Feeling that you are inherently bad; about the person, not just behavior.
- Importance of separating behavior from self-worth.

#### Healthy vs. Toxic Guilt
- **Healthy Guilt**:
 - Motivates positive change and learning.
 - Anger at oneself for a behavior or omission.
 - Helps align actions with values.
- **Toxic Guilt**:
 - Drains energy and erodes self-esteem.
 - Leads to ongoing self-anger without productive action.
 - Often paired with shame.

#### Effects of Toxic Guilt
- Continuous stress response activation.
- Desperate attempts to prove worth.
- Leads to behaviors like fawning or overcompensating.

#### Causes of Toxic Guilt
- Holding onto “shoulds” imposed by others or oneself.
- Feeling responsible for things outside one’s control.
- Survivor’s guilt and guilt over others' feelings.
- Guilt for not being perfect or successful.
- Societal and familial messages about worth and success.

#### Solutions and Strategies
1. **Identify the Source**:
  - Determine if the guilt stems from internal values or external pressures.
  - Evaluate the “shoulds” and decide if they align with personal values.

2. **Healthy Boundaries**:
  - Recognize and assert personal beliefs and values.
  - Don’t let others dictate what should make you feel guilty.

3. **Cognitive Restructuring**:
  - Write down situations causing guilt.
  - Distinguish between controllable and uncontrollable aspects.
  - Use energy positively to address controllable factors.

4. **Acceptance and Letting Go**:
  - Accept that some things are beyond control.
  - Reflect on personal growth and changes over time.
  - Practice self-compassion for past mistakes.

5. **Self-Care**:
  - Prioritize personal well-being to prevent burnout.
  - View self-care as a model for others.

6. **Assertiveness**:
  - Stand firm in personal beliefs even when others disagree.
  - Practice expressing your values respectfully.

#### Practical Steps
- Write down situations causing guilt.
- Identify controllable and uncontrollable aspects.
- Take action on what you can control.
- Reflect on whether you’ve done all you can.
- Accept powerlessness over some outcomes.
- Practice forgiveness and self-compassion.
- Set and maintain healthy boundaries.

      <title>996-Unlocking Recovery: Exploring Models and Theories of Addiction</title>
      <description>#### Introduction
- Presenter: Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes
- Topic: Theories of addiction and co-occurring disorders
- Focus on understanding and addressing co-occurring disorders in addiction treatment

#### Co-Occurring Disorders
- Expectation rather than the exception in addiction treatment
- Importance of addressing co-occurring symptoms to prevent relapse
- Symptoms can include depression, anxiety, PTSD, and personality disorders

#### Theories of Addiction
1. **Moral Theory**
  - Addiction seen as a moral weakness
  - Treatment focused on willpower and virtuous lifestyle
  - Largely outdated

2. **Disease Theory**
  - Addiction as a chronic, incurable, and progressive disease
  - Genetic and biological factors play a significant role
  - Focus on physiological deficits and neurotransmitter imbalances

3. **Social Learning Theory**
  - Addiction learned through observation and vicarious reinforcement
  - Influence of family, peers, and media on addictive behaviors

4. **Cognitive-Behavioral Theory**
  - Irrational thoughts and cognitive distortions lead to addiction
  - Addressing negative thinking patterns is crucial for recovery

5. **Self-Medication Hypothesis**

  - Individuals use substances or behaviors to manage unbearable feelings

6. **Biopsychosocial Model**

  - Recognizes the interplay of various elements in the development of addiction

#### Key Symptoms in Early Recovery
- Depression: Hopelessness, low energy, guilt, suicidal ideation
- Anxiety: Increased worry, irritability, restlessness

[Watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZR-UqWpVgE)

**Outline Summary:**

1. **Introduction**
  - Presenter: Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes
  - Topic: Breaking free from quick fixes and healing deep wounds
  - Objectives: Discuss quick fixes, their problems, the impact of deep wounds, and healing strategies.

2. **The Allure and Problem of Quick Fixes**
  - Quick fixes are often superficial and temporary.
  - They fail to address the root causes, leading to recurring issues.
  - Example: Using antacids for stress-related GI distress without addressing the stress.

3. **Impact of Deep Wounds**
  - **Physical Impact**: Alters brain structure and neurotransmitter balance.
  - **Interpersonal Impact**: Affects ability to trust others and lowers self-esteem.
  - **Emotional Impact**: Causes anger, anxiety, depression, and emotional dysregulation.
  - **Cognitive Impact**: Leads to negative beliefs about oneself and the world, overgeneralization, and unfiled traumatic memories.
  - **Environmental Impact**: Triggers through associated sights, sounds, and smells.

4. **Strategies for Healing Deep Wounds**
  - **Recognizing the Impact**: Understand the effect of wounds on brain, energy, and health.
  - **Reducing Stress**: Physical and emotional stress reduction through sleep, nutrition, pain management, and relaxation.
  - **Managing Emotions**: Downregulate emotions to engage the wise mind, using techniques like deep breathing, guided imagery, and support systems.
  - **Distress Tolerance**: Develop skills to tolerate distress without resolving underlying issues, e.g., shifting focus, physical activity, and alternate thoughts.

5. **Understanding Emotions and Triggers**
  - **Identifying Emotions**: Understand that anger and anxiety signal potential threats, not actual problems.
  - **Evaluating Emotions**: Assess the facts and context of emotional responses.
  - **Exploring Deep Wounds**: Validate past feelings and reframe beliefs with a mature perspective.
  - **Addressing Cognitive Distortions**: Identify and challenge thoughts stemming from deep wounds.

6. **Creating a Healing Plan**
  - **Downregulating Emotions**: Use tools to manage emotional intensity.
  - **Examining Beliefs**: Re-evaluate beliefs in the current context and find alternative explanations.
  - **Healing Over Time**: Recognize that healing is a gradual process requiring focus and energy.

      <title>988-Essential Guide to Understanding and Responding to Children's Anxiety</title>
      <description>### Summary of the Video

#### Introduction
- Presenter: Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes
- Topic: Understanding Anxiety Through a Child's Eyes

#### What is Anxiety?
- Anxiety is essentially fear, part of the fight-or-flight response.
- Children and adults share similar fears but children may have broader fears due to less life experience.

#### Common Fears in Children
- Death and safety concerns, not only for themselves but for their caregivers.
- Fear of rejection, isolation, and abandonment.
- Anxiety about the unknown and loss of control.

#### Developmental Impact on Anxiety
- Children’s fears are influenced by their developmental stage.
- Younger children have stronger emotional responses due to underdeveloped reasoning areas in the brain.
- Children often exhibit more somatic symptoms and behaviorally express their anxiety.

#### Symptoms of Anxiety in Children
- Increased sensitivity and irritability.
- Behavioral changes such as meltdowns, compulsive behaviors, and avoidance.
- Physical signs like headaches, stomach aches, restlessness, and sleep disturbances.
- Cognitive symptoms like excessive worry and difficulty concentrating.

#### Misdiagnoses
- Anxiety can be mistaken for ADD, autism spectrum disorders, PTSD, and depression.
- Differentiating anxiety from other disorders is crucial for effective treatment.

#### Interventions for Managing Anxiety
- Establish a secure attachment and consistent mindfulness of the child's emotional state.
- Use empathy and validation to encourage open communication.
- Teach distress tolerance and mindfulness techniques.
- Provide structure, predictability, and clear expectations to reduce anxiety.
- Encourage positive self-talk, visualizations, and support networks.

#### Addressing Cognitive Distortions
- Help children identify and challenge all-or-nothing thinking, personalization, and magnification.
- Encourage factual analysis and identification of exceptions to anxious thoughts.

#### Developmental Considerations
- Infants and toddlers require responsive caregiving to build trust and security.
- Preschool and school-age children benefit from structured environments and clear communication about plans and expectations.
- Older children and adolescents need support in developing identity and understanding complex emotions.

      <title>986-Supportive to Solution Focused Interventions</title>
      <description>### Summary of the Video

#### Introduction
- Presenter: Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes
- Topic: Moving from supportive to solution-focused interventions, primarily with children and adolescents.

#### Differentiating Interventions
- Supportive Interventions:
 - Grounded in empathy
 - Aim to help individuals survive the moment and return to emotional regulation
 - Analogous to plugging a hole in a sinking ship temporarily
  
- Solution-Focused Interventions:
 - Aim to help individuals move from surviving to thriving
 - Focus on long-term solutions and prevention of future issues

#### Supportive Interventions
- Establish rapport and validate feelings
- Techniques include active listening, radical acceptance, and distress tolerance activities
- Help individuals re-regulate emotionally and return to their baseline state

#### Examples of Supportive Interventions
- Active listening
- Radical acceptance: Encouraging acceptance of reality to reduce distress
- Distress tolerance activities: Techniques to help manage immediate emotional distress

#### Transition to Solution-Focused Interventions
- Requires the individual to be emotionally regulated and ready to problem-solve
- Involves identifying problems and hoped-for resolutions
- Encourages brainstorming and implementing practical solutions

#### Solution-Focused Techniques
- Identifying strengths and past successes
- Looking for exceptions to the problem
- Encouraging realistic goal setting and problem-solving

#### Challenges in Transitioning to Solution-Focused Interventions
- Individuals may get stuck in supportive interventions due to:
 - Denial or avoidance
 - Feeling overwhelmed
 - Dependency on others to fix their problems
 - Stigma associated with their issues

#### Enhancing Motivation for Change
- Highlight the benefits of making changes versus staying the same
- Use decisional balance charts to weigh pros and cons
- Provide continuous reinforcement and follow-up

#### Special Considerations
- Developmental disabilities and severe depression may require tailored approaches
- Consider cultural sensitivity and appropriateness of interventions
- Ensure interventions match the individual's developmental level and personal context

#### Maintaining Motivation
- Regular check-ins and assignments to keep individuals on track
- Reinforcement for effort and progress
- Avoid rewarding backsliding and encourage continued problem-solving

#### Addressing Underlying Issues
- Help individuals understand and address the root causes of their distress
- Encourage looking at all contributing factors and focusing on controllable aspects
- Use narrative therapy and cognitive processing techniques for deeper exploration

#### Introduction
- Explanation of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
- Importance of CBT and its impact on thoughts, feelings, and behaviors
- Overview of the session's structure: what CBT is, what works, what doesn’t, and why

#### Understanding CBT
- CBT focuses on the interaction between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors
- Cognitive schemas: mental shortcuts based on past experiences
- Importance of checking and updating schemas as they may not always be accurate

#### Effects of Stress on the Brain
- Persistent stress impacts brain structure and function
- Weakens the vagus nerve, which affects the body's relaxation response
- Causes changes in the nervous system, impacting sleep and circadian rhythms

#### What Doesn’t Work in CBT
- Jumping into cognitive processing without establishing rapport, safety, and empowerment
- Aggressive confrontation of beliefs and behaviors
- Failing to address all three points of the CBT triangle: thoughts, feelings, and behaviors
- Telling instead of exploring, using mechanistic approaches, and not individualizing therapy
- Forcing new beliefs or schemas that the client doesn’t believe

#### What Works in CBT
- Educating clients about the connection between feelings, thoughts, and behaviors
- Validating clients' experiences and feelings
- Helping clients develop emotional intelligence and distress tolerance
- Addressing behaviors that create vulnerabilities
- Using a personalized approach to explore and alter unhelpful schemas and beliefs
- Maintaining motivation and reinforcing new thoughts and behaviors between sessions

#### Application of CBT in Various Disorders
- **ADHD**: Developing organizational skills, addressing negative self-referential beliefs, and improving communication
- **Mood Disorders**: Identifying behaviors that create vulnerabilities, developing distress tolerance, and empowering clients to address problematic thoughts and behaviors
- **Addiction**: Developing mindfulness, reducing vulnerabilities, exploring cognitive distortions, and addressing distress tolerance
- **Personality Disorders**: Understanding the underlying thoughts and beliefs, addressing behaviors, and enhancing coping mechanisms
- **Schizophrenia**: Joining clients in their reality, reducing stress, and developing safety plans
- **Trauma**: Normalizing thoughts and behaviors, developing distress tolerance, and exploring schemas related to trauma

#### ABCDEs of CBT
- **A**wareness: Recognize thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and their communication
- **B**ehaviors: Reduce vulnerabilities and increase safety and empowerment
- **C**ognitions and Schema: Explore and restructure based on current and past contexts
- **D**istress Tolerance: Develop skills to manage distress

      <title>977-Empowering Children for Life: The Key to Psychological Flexibility</title>
      <description>### Summary of the Video: "Creating Psychological Flexibility in Children"

**Introduction to Psychological Flexibility**
- **Definition**: Psychological flexibility involves being aware of the present moment and making conscious choices from available options to handle situations effectively.
- **Importance for Children**: Teaching children psychological flexibility helps them manage emotions and behaviors, improving their overall well-being and resilience.

**Vulnerabilities Affecting Psychological Flexibility**
- **Physical States**: Tiredness, malnutrition, hunger, stress, sickness, and pain can impair a child's ability to be psychologically flexible.
- **Good Habits**: Establishing routines, particularly around sleep and nutrition, helps children maintain a stable emotional state and better handle stress.

**Building Psychological Flexibility in Children**
- **Early Education**: Start teaching good habits like sleep hygiene and nutrition early on. Use routines and explain the benefits of these habits to children.
- **Positive Health Behaviors**: Encourage activities like regular exercise, proper handwashing, and balanced nutrition to support physical and mental health.

**Cognitive Techniques for Psychological Flexibility**
- **Mindfulness**: Teach children to observe their thoughts and feelings without judgment. Use metaphors like "thoughts as passing clouds" to help them understand the transient nature of emotions.
- **Cognitive Diffusion**: Help children unhook from negative thoughts by recognizing them as temporary and not defining their identity.
- **Acceptance**: Encourage acceptance of situations and feelings as they are, focusing on what can be controlled and changed.

**Practical Activities and Metaphors**
- **Behavioral Matrix**: Use a matrix to help children identify behaviors, thoughts, and feelings that drain their energy versus those that support their goals and values.
- **Analogies**: Use simple analogies like a cell phone battery to explain energy management and the impact of different activities on their well-being.

**Dealing with Distress**
- **Objective Evaluation**: Teach children to objectively assess situations and their reactions, identifying helpful versus unhelpful responses.
- **Response Options**: Help them brainstorm alternative responses that align with their values and goals, encouraging proactive rather than reactive behavior.

**Empowering Children with Choice**
- **Empowerment**: Empower children by showing them that they have choices in how they respond to situations, promoting a sense of control and self-efficacy.
- **Preventive Strategies**: Maintain a visible prevention matrix to remind children of their healthy options and strategies to manage stress.

Structure

Socialization

Like humans, there are triggers all around that remind you of your pet

Sights, sounds, smells

Rituals

You may second guess yourself or feel guilt if you had to make an end-of-life decision or if the death was particularly premature

The loss of a child's pet may trigger a sense of guilt and helplessness as the child grieves

The loss of a pet may trigger memories of prior losses and open old wounds

This was the only secure relationship I ever had. Death of your parent's pet

The loss of a pet may trigger reflection on your own mortality


TIMESTAMPS 
00:00 Introduction 
00:38 Human Pet Bond 
07:35 Impact of Pet Loss 
15:50 Grief and Disenfranchised Grief

      <title>Moral Injury and Abandonment</title>
      <link>https://www.allceus.com/podcast/moral-injury-and-abandonment/</link>
      <description>Moral Injury of Abandonment
Moral injury is traumatic and may involve the loss of a sense of 
Self (This is not who I am / I am a bad person)
Safety (I am not safe, others will reject me because of what I did)
Personal power (I had no choice or say in the matter)
It is important to use context and consider all the factors at play when helping people examine and reconcile the situation
Often they did the best they could with the tools they had in that situation at that time
Moral injury is defined as the profound psychological distress which results from actions, or the lack of them, which violate one’s moral or ethical code. 
Abandonment means leaving, relinquishing or even choosing one over another.
People sometimes have to make the devastating choice to abandon one thing for the good of another
Other times (terminal illness) they may not have a choice
People may also suffer moral injury by proxy when the leaders of a culture with whom they identify engage in morally reprehensible acts.
Moral injury has multiple PACER impacts

~ Thyroid hormones can be altered by physical or emotional stress
~ Thyroid hormones via the HPT axis are intertwined with the HPA-Axis –dysfunction in one produces dysfunction in the other
~ Many cognitive, affective and behavioral symptoms commonly seen in behavioral health settings may have some underpinnings in thyroid dysfunction
~ Mental health clinicians can educate patients about the far-reaching impact of thyroid hormones; help them address cognitive and emotional stress and trauma and address sleep and circadian rhythms.

      <title>The Impact of Gut Health For Mental Health and  Relapse Prevention</title>
      <link>https://www.allceus.com/podcast/the-impact-of-gut-health-for-mental-health-and-relapse-prevention/</link>
      <description>Objectives
- BREIFLY review the findings from the research identifying the connection between the brain and the gut
- Differentiate gut health from proper nutrition

- Identify promising alternative approaches to treating mood (and other) disorders.
Overview
- Depression is the leading cause of disability in the world according to the World Health Organization. The effectiveness of the available antidepressant therapies is limited. 
- Data from the literature suggest that some subtypes of depression may be associated with chronic low grade inflammation. 
- The uncovering of the role of intestinal microbiota in the development of the immune system and its bidirectional communication with the brain have led to growing interest on reciprocal interactions between inflammation, microbiota and depression. 
- The intestinal microbiota: A new player in depression? Encephale. 2018 Feb;44(1):67-74

      <title>The Impact of Addiction on the Child’s Brain</title>
      <link>https://www.allceus.com/podcast/the-impact-of-addiction-on-the-childs-brain/</link>
      <description>Summary
- Like a bonzai tree there are times when the brain is developing and malleable.
- The brain begins development in the first trimester and continues until age 24.
- During adolescence different parts of the brain develop at different times (different branches of the tree)
- An insult to the immature brain can cause much more dramatic changes because of its malleability (sapling vs. hardened branch)
- All drugs appear to alter parts of the brain associated with learning, memory, emotion regulation, planning and problem solving and impulse control.

      <title>Integrative Approach to Supporting the Homeschooling Family</title>
      <link>https://www.allceus.com/podcast/integrative-approach-to-supporting-the-homeschooling-family/</link>
      <description>Objectives
- Explore the impact of homeschooling on the family
- Identify issues that may come up during homeschooling
- Explore creative ways to help families effectively homeschool
Impact of Homeschooling
- Physical
- It is easy for the child’s schedule to get out of synch when they don’t have to get up to meet a bus
- Maintain a schedule
- There is a risk of greater weight gain related physical problems due to a lack of enforced PE and 24/7 availability of food
- Mindful eating, cooking, fun activities, nutrition literacy
- Some children may rely on free and reduced breakfast and lunch and will no longer be able to access that.
- Work with food pantries and volunteers to disperse care packages
- Increased risk for unnoticed child abuse or neglect when children are home all day
- Conversely, children could get more sleep, be exposed to fewer germs, encouraged to be active in meaningful ways, learn how to eat mindfully as well as develop culinary skills.

      <title>Meeting the Mental Health Needs of Asian People</title>
      <link>https://www.allceus.com/podcast/meeting-the-mental-health-needs-of-asian-people/</link>
      <description>- Learn about Asian cultures, traditions and values as they relate to mental health
- Learn about communication styles to help the counselor more effectively communicate with culturally different clients
- Explore health disparities
- Explore appropriate approaches to counseling
General Information
- Asian Americans have a 17.30 percent overall lifetime rate of any psychiatric disorder and a 9.19 percent 12-month rate, yet Asian Americans are three times less likely to seek mental health services than Whites
- Cultural factors, such as language, age, gender, and others, can influence the mental health of Asians, particularly immigrants
- Asians place great value on the family as a unit. Each individual has a clearly defined role and position in the family hierarchy and is expected to function within that role, submitting to the larger needs of the family.
- Social stigma, shame, and saving face often prevent Asians from seeking behavioral health care
- Asian patients are likely to express psychological distress as physical complaints

      <link>https://www.allceus.com/podcast/behavioral-health-services-for-american-indians-and-alaskan-natives-samhsa-tip-61/</link>
      <description>Summary
- There is no one right way. Providing direction on how something should be done is not a comfortable or customary practice for American Indians and Alaska Natives. For them, healing is interconnected with others and comes from within, from ancestry, from stories, and from the environment.
RESPECT
- Respect communication styles and how respect is shown in the culture
- Explanatory model: Understand how clients perceive/understand their presenting issues
- Sociocultural context affect treatment
- Participation expectations for treatment may be different than mainstream. (family, community, faith healers etc.)
- Empathy
- Concerns and fears should be elicited (at the beginning and at points of resistance)
- Trust is based on who you are not what you accomplished.

      <title>CBD In Treatment of Alzheimers, Addictions and Mood Disorders</title>
      <link>https://www.allceus.com/podcast/cbd-in-treatment-of-alzheimers-addictions-and-mood-disorders/</link>
      <description>Summary
- CBD is showing promise as an alternative or adjunctive treatment for a variety of ailments ranging from Alzheimer’s and Addiction to Parkinson’s and Schizophrenia.
- CBD does not have the psychogenic effects that THC does, however, THC has been found to be more effective at addressing some issues
- OTC CBD is nonstandardized so dosages, even from the same manufacturer, but in different lots may have different potencies
- CBD interacts with most medications, so it is vital to consult a physician prior to using it.
- Dosages of CBD in the literature varied widely.
- Currently there are a couple CBD based medications for the treatment of seizure disorder
- CBD oils also may have a trace of THC in them—again, in OTC formulations, it may be variable, but supposed to be less than 0.3%

      <title>Anger Management Multi-Session Protocol</title>
      <link>https://www.allceus.com/podcast/480-anger-management-multi-session-protocol/</link>
      <description>Summary
~ Anger is a natural emotion. It is designed to alert people that there MIGHT be a problem.
~ When people are vulnerable or learned maladaptive ways of dealing with anger or simply never learned healthy coping skills they can experience anger management problems
~ Excessive anger negatively impacts people emotionally, mentally, physically, socially, occupationally, legally and spiritually.
~ Effective anger management involves preventing vulnerabilities, being aware of and working on “sensitive areas” or “threat areas,” preventing anger whenever possible and developing immediate coping responses to deal with it when it occurs.

      <title>Individual and Group Exercises for Anger and Anxiety</title>
      <link>https://www.allceus.com/podcast/individual-and-group-exercises-for-anger-and-anxiety/</link>
      <description>Summary
    • Anger and anxiety are normal emotions that help people survive.
    • Answers can often be found by asking: “What happened to this person that would trigger this reaction?”
    • Situations that trigger anger and anxiety often involve a sense of being unsafe, a loss of something, emotions that are unable to be handled effectively, and an alteration of how that person envisions the future.
    • Problems arise when anger and anxiety are misinterpreted or the person does not have the skills to deal with the problem
    • Anger is not a simple emotion, it often covers up shame, embarrassment, guilt and/or anxiety.
    • By helping people identify the roots of their anger and more effective strategies, they can be empowered to reduce the frequency and intensity of these emotions and more effectively cope when they do arise.

      <title>Grief</title>
      <link>https://www.allceus.com/podcast/grief/</link>
      <description>Summary
    • Losses encompass more than death or a person or loss of property
    • Failure to acknowledge losses can cause unhelpful reactions in similar future situations
    • It is important to explore feelings and reactions in terms of their functionality---how are they benefitting the person
    • It takes at least a year to deal with significant losses
    • Many times there are multiple ancillary losses that need to be addressed
    • How people deal with grief and loss varies widely.
    • Grieving is a form of crisis
    • The body is on high alert which likely impacts sleep, eating and energy to work or socialize
    • Minimizing vulnerabilities is important to reduce unnecessary frustration and avoid confirming helplessness
    • Ultimately it is hoped that the person can identify how they are stronger or better off from the experience

    • Are unaware of their internal feelings, thoughts, urges
    • Are unaware of the motivation (in context) of their feelings, thoughts, urges
    • Use rigid problem solving and conceptualization without considering context or perspective
    • Contextual CBT uses awareness, mindfulness, radical acceptance and psychological flexibility activities to help people move toward a rich and meaningful life instead of trying to escape or avoid discomfort.

      <title>Understanding Anxiety through a Child’s Eyes</title>
      <link>https://www.allceus.com/podcast/understanding-anxiety-through-a-childs-eye/</link>
      <description>Summary - Children’s cognitive, physical and experiential differences make their anxiety different than that of adults - Children’s symptoms of anxiety also often manifest differently with more irritability, defiance and somatic complaints. - Anxiety disorders are frequently misdiagnosed as ADD, autism, ODD and PTSD - Children’s fears often focus around Maslow’s lower three needs: Biological, Safety, Love and Belonging - Addressing anxiety means helping the child understand, in a developmentally appropriate way, that they will have what they need, they are safe and they will always belong and be loved.

      <title>Addressing the Unique Mental Health Needs of College Students</title>
      <link>https://www.allceus.com/podcast/addressing-the-unique-mental-health-needs-of-college-students/</link>
      <description>Summary
- To thrive, students need access to services and programs of outreach, education, and prevention that:
- Eliminate fragmentation and improving access to biopsychosocial services
- Recognize patterns in campus life that suggest the presence of mental and behavioral health concerns among individual students, groups of students, or the campus environment itself
- Provide outreach and consultation to prepare all members of the campus community to recognize and respond to students with mental or behavioral health concerns
- Emphasize case-finding—using surveys, presentations, self-assessments, activities, and special events—to identify students whose lack of psychological well-being is interfering with their development, learning, and achievement
- To thrive, students need access to services and programs of outreach, education, and prevention that
- Nurture a supportive tone and attitude about mental health in campus culture to 
- challenge stereotypes about mental health problems
- undermine prejudices and stigma about counseling
- provide encouragement to students to reflect on their own mental health and seek services when needed

~	 30% to 40% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) do not respond sufficiently to usual antidepressant treatment
~	Even under optimal treatment conditions, only one-third of patients achieve remission
~	Among patients who fail to respond to two pharmacologic interventions, remission rates with the next antidepressant are as low as 12%
~	 A patient becomes less likely to respond clinically with each additional nonresponse to antidepressant treatment

      <description>A healthy body is necessary to feel your best emotionally. Brain chemicals that help you feel happy and relaxed are created from the foods you eat. Sunlight sets your circadian rhythms so you get quality sleep and produces vitamin D which helps relieve depression. Exercise, stretching and yoga can all help increase the happy chemicals, reduce pain and improve sleep. Pain is a fact of life. There are many options for pain management other than drugs. (Many pain medications are system depressants)

      <description>The way people think and perceive situations has a huge impact on how they feel. Helping people embrace the dialectics can help them feel more positive and empowered.

      <title>Interplay Between Addiction And Mental Health</title>
      <link>https://www.allceus.com/podcast/024-interplay-between-addiction-and-mental-health/</link>
      <description>Addiction is a way people try to escape from physical or emotional distress. Addiction can also create chemical imbalances that create that distress. A sober person with depression is as much at risk for addiction relapse as a person who continues to use is at risk of worsening depression. It is imperative to address everything causing the neurochemical imbalances from negative thoughts, to addiction to inadequate sleep and nutrition. In this episode we will examine some of the different starting points for addressing co-occurring mood and addiction issues.

Initially addictions may be used to escape from distress, but, through use, people are unknowingly making their mood and other problems worse. In this episode we examine the impacts of chemical and behavioral addictions on the person, and propose some interventions that could serve as launch points for recovery.

      <title>What are Co-Occurring Disorders and How Do They Impact Treatment Part 3</title>
      <link>https://www.allceus.com/podcast/014-what-are-co-occurring-disorders-and-how-do-they-impact-treatment-part-3/</link>
      <description>Many people struggling with addictions also have mental health issues such as depression or anxiety. Likewise, many people with depression or anxiety may have an addiction. We refer to this as a co-occurring disorder. Some people will try to argue that symptoms of depression and anxiety are caused by drug use, and once you are clean and sober those symptoms will go away. While this may be true for some, these symptoms that are still present in early recovery can cause a relapse. After all, how long will someone stay clean and sober if they are constantly depressed or anxious. Regardless of whether you self-medicated a mental health issue with your addiction, or your addiction caused your mental health issues, BOTH need to be addressed. In this episode wee will: Develop a broad biopsychosocial definition of co-occurring disorders. Learn about the reciprocal interaction between mental health, physical health and addiction. Discuss the multiple contributing factors of mood disorders to include physical issues and issues stemming from addictive behaviors. Explore ways to simultaneously address multiple disorders.

      <title>Mental Health Medications: Antidepressants, Mood Stabilizers, and Antipsychotics</title>
      <link>https://www.allceus.com/podcast/008-mental-health-medications-antidepressants-mood-stabilizers-and-antipsychotics/</link>
      <description>Hundreds of thousands of people are on medications to address mood and mental health disorders. Many people try one medication, and when it doesn't work, they feel hopeless. What they do not realize is that, since we cannot accurately measure the levels of neurochemicals in your brain, diagnosis and prescribing is part art, and part science. A variety of different chemical imbalances besides low serotonin can cause depressive symptoms, for example. In this episode we will discuss three common classes of medications: Antidepressants, Mood Stabilizers and Antipsychotics, the neurotransmitters on which they are believed to work and the symptoms of insufficiency and excess of each of these neurotransmitters.

      <title>Relapse Prevention for Co-Occurring Mental Health and Addictive Disorders</title>
      <link>https://www.allceus.com/podcast/005-relapse-prevention-for-co-occurring-mental-health-and-addictive-disorders/</link>
      <description>Relapse means returning to a previous state. It is vital to understand that relapse does not just mean a return to addictive behaviors, nor does it mean just using. Relapses can happen in terms of people's mood, thinking patterns and behaviors. In actuality, a person's thinking patterns and behavior often become problematic long before they start showing symptoms of addiction or depression again. Some people call this return to old ways of thinking, behaving and feeling as "relapse warning signs" or "lapses." In my mind, it is actually the beginning of a relapse. That doesn't mean that the behaviors have to be continued to the point of using again. A relapse can stopped and corrected at any point. The earlier these old behaviors and ways of thinking are stopped, the less more likely the person is to stay healthy and happy. In this episode we will discuss ways to remain mindful in order to address any potential issues before they start impacting recovery.

      <title>Understanding Triggers and Craving in Addictive Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://www.allceus.com/podcast/004-understanding-triggers-and-craving-in-addictive-behaviors/</link>
      <description>In addictive behaviors, triggers make you want to use and cravings are the repetitive thoughts reminding you over and over again that you want to use. We have triggers for just about everything. Some are obvious, like the sight of alcohol may trigger people to start craving a drink. Some are not so obvious, the impending anniversary of a loss may trigger a person to want to use alcohol or drugs to escape from the grief. In this presentation we will cover what triggers are, discuss ways to identify personal triggers and explore ways of dealing with triggers and cravings.
