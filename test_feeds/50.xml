      <description>Al’s trip behind-the-scenes of the production office reveals that the much-contemplated “Judge Jase” tv show might actually be gaining some traction, but the crew needs Unashamed Nation to weigh in on it! Zach’s wheels start spinning with the possibilities, and Missy takes a moment to admire Jase’s woodchopping muscles after he spends the weekend helping a neighbor with a fallen tree.

      <title>Ep 1039 | Phil's Difficult Recovery from Surgery &amp; the Jase Namesakes Spawned by ‘Duck Dynasty’ Fans </title>
      <description>Jase offers an update on Phil's challenging recovery from his latest procedure. Al meets young men named Jase all over the country because their parents were “Duck Dynasty” fans, and wonders just how many there are. Jase seems to actually enjoy his status as a “fashion model” for outdoorsmen and attempts to include a young fan in his onstage demonstration, but it backfires spectacularly. Plus, how to turn any conversation into a Jesus conversation. 

In this episode: John 1, verse 35; 2 Corinthians 3, verse 7

      <title>Ep 1037 | Jase Witnesses Demonic Possession &amp; Answering a Call that Will Change Your Life</title>
      <description>Jase, Zach, and Jersey Joe trade a flurry of zingers and good-natured critiques while Al looks on in delight. Joe assumes Jase’s choice to wear women’s cold weather gear gives him superpowers, when actually it’s Jase’s experimentation with European coffee blends. Jase suspects demonic forces may be at work on the podcast. The guys point out that immigration into God’s kingdom is not limited to a spot on a map, and Joe lays out the ways his life has gotten better since he answered the call to Jesus. 

In this episode: John 1, verses 12-13; John 3, verses 27-36

        <![CDATA[<p>Jase, Zach, and Jersey Joe trade a flurry of zingers and good-natured critiques while Al looks on in delight. Joe assumes Jase’s choice to wear women’s cold weather gear gives him superpowers, when actually it’s Jase’s experimentation with European coffee blends. Jase suspects demonic forces may be at work on the podcast. The guys point out that immigration into God’s kingdom is not limited to a spot on a map, and Joe lays out the ways his life has gotten better since he answered the call to Jesus. </p><p><br></p><p>In this episode: John 1, verses 12-13; John 3, verses 27-36</p><p><br></p><p>“Unashamed” Episode 1037 is sponsored by: </p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://puretalk.com/unashamed">https://puretalk.com/unashamed</a> — SAVE 50% off your first month when you switch to America’s wireless company PureTalk</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://tnusa.com/unashamed">https://tnusa.com/unashamed</a> — Talk to a strategist for FREE and put your IRS troubles behind you.

      <description>Jase’s hot take on the shortcomings of a significant portion of the hunting population might cause a riot, but he stands by his words. The guys delve into the paradox of Christ living “in us” when scriptures repeatedly show he can’t be contained by created things. Jase points out the first time fake news ever happened in the history of the world. Plus, was Jesus’ baptism really necessary?

In this episode: John 1, verse 19; 1 Kings 8, verses 22-27; Revelation 2, verse 21; 1 Peter 2, verse 4; Hebrews 6, verse 19; Hebrews 9, verses 24-28

      <title>Ep 1035 | Phil Delivers a Fiery Portrayal of John the Baptist &amp; Jase’s Date Night Gone Wrong</title>
      <description>The tape has surfaced of Phil’s full performance as John the Baptist during an Easter drama nearly thirty years ago, and the guys are thrilled. A weather anomaly at Al’s house leads Jase down memory lane and how he used fish heads to capture Missy’s heart on their second date. The guys make connections between the lives of Moses, Elijah, John the Baptist, Jesus, and even Phil, and how God’s power is demonstrated repeatedly in similar ways throughout history.

In this episode: John 1, verses 31-32; Matthew 11, verse 12; Luke 1, verses 11-37

      <title>Ep 1031 | Jase's Unexpected Intervention w/ Dr. John Delony &amp; The Loneliest Generation in Human History</title>
      <description>Jase is getting intervention vibes over the amount of mental health professionals he’s been hosting lately, including Dr. John Delony, a national bestselling author, host of “The Dr. John Delony Show,” and co-host of “The Ramsey Show” with Dave Ramsey. John lays out compelling evidence about the current mental spiral of today’s society, but he and Jase have come up with proven ways to combat the tech-dependency of young people. Zach and John discuss the need to be “right” in relationships versus the need to love well.

      <description>Al goes back to the origin of the Robertson family’s love-hate relationship with fast food, leaving himself, Zach, Willie, and Jep open for a zinger from Jase.

The guys debate instances of “baptism” in the Old Testament and why it’s important to us even today.

The guys emphasize the importance of mentorship, especially in the lives of young men during this day and age, and Jase finds a “faith test” in the Bible.

      <description>Jase, Al, and Zach deliberate what the next four years under President Trump’s leadership will bring and offer up a prayer for his guidance of the American people. While Zach schools Jase on the Federal Reserve, Jase relives that time he befriended and baptized an actual currency counterfeiter. Al looks forward to seeing the impact of having multiple tech billionaires onboard with the new administration, and the guys find a way to poke fun at Zach's brief career in politics.

In this episode: Hebrews 3, verse 4; Romans 13, verses 1-3

      <title>Ep 1025 | Phil's Most Off-the-Wall Advice &amp; Jase Sparks a Gender Controversy No One Saw Coming</title>
      <description>Jase preached a sermon that was so mind-blowing he thought the church members might stone him for it, and Zach benefits from the most seemingly arbitrary advice Phil has ever given. The guys deliberate the meaning of life both eternally and earthly, and pose the question: “WHY did Jesus die?” Jase’s consideration of life and community leads him to get a little sappy with Missy on his way out the door, and Al floats a theory about the difference between modern and ancient people’s main struggle with accepting Jesus.

In this episode: John 1, verses 1-13; John 6, verse 47; 1 John 4, verse 10; Galatians 2, verse 17; Ephesians 4, verse 28; Ezekiel 36, verse 26

      <title>Ep 1017 | Jase Shuts Down Twisted Attempts to Weaponize the Bible Against God</title>
      <description>Jase makes it crystal clear that any claim that God condones the atrocity of slavery is a perversion of God's Word — God is the ultimate corrector of all injustices. Al and Jase connect the book of Philemon to the events and people of Colossians, and Al is impressed with the masterful way Paul uses his letter to Philemon to ask for a pretty huge favor. Plus, get a behind-the-scenes peek at The Lair, the rustic studio where “Unashamed” is filmed! 

In this episode: Colossians 4, verses 2-9; Ephesians 2, verses 14-16; Philemon 1, verses 4-25

      <title>Ep 1012 | Mia Announced Her Return to Jesus with a Piano &amp; Jase Was Wrecked</title>
      <description>Jase wasn’t much of a crier for three decades, but then Mia did something so profound that he couldn’t help weeping. Zach points out the musical abilities that run strongly in members of the Robertson family and speculates that Missy might have even inspired a song by award-winning Christian singer Brandon Lake. The guys look at the structure of God’s kingdom as a family, how our families mirror our relationship with God, and why Satan’s ultimate goal is to destroy the spiritual and physical family unit.

In this episode: John 14, verses 25-27; Colossians 3, verses 10-14

      <title>Ep 1005 | The Billy Graham Rule: Is It Wrong for Unmarried Men &amp; Women to Be Alone Together?</title>
      <description>Jase breaks away from a potentially disastrous back rub from a woman he didn’t know by using a creative, Jesus-centric excuse. The guys offer examples of their own “Billy Graham rule,” where even the appearance of sexual impurity must be guarded against, especially in ministry. Zach explores the basis of identity politics, where the concept comes from, and ultimately the only healthy source of human identity. The guys explore three avenues of earthly desires that must be reordered to God’s will or they result in anxiety, depression, and pain. 

In this episode: John 14, verse 23; Hebrews 9, verses 24-25; Romans 8, verse 11

      <title>Ep 1002 | Allie Beth Stuckey Leads the Way for Christians to Talk About Social Issues with Love</title>
      <description>Jase, Al, Zach, and Missy discuss the exploitation of Christian compassion with Allie Beth Stuckey, the BlazeTV host of the “Relatable” podcast and author of the NYT bestseller “Toxic Empathy.” Allie Beth offers a guide for talking about such emotional subjects within our society and how Christians can recognize when they're being manipulated by political factions and the secular establishment. Missy’s recent brush with politics and President Trump leaves her more motivated than ever to speak out for truth, and the guys are impressed by Allie Beth’s articulate and compassionate expression of her deeply held values.

      <title>Ep 994 | Uncle Si Spooks Jase’s Houseguests &amp; Jase Comes Home to a Yard Full of Reporters</title>
      <description>Jase discovers that he might be more immature than he thought after his brush with disaster on a child’s hoverboard toy. Uncle Si’s craziness disturbs Jase’s houseguests, and Jase comes home to find a press mob looking for a story in his own front yard. Maturing in Jesus is like riding a bike — it’s something that we learn to do better with experience, and it eventually becomes ingrained in our souls. Jase stresses thankfulness for God’s mercy as Paul stresses it throughout Colossians.Zach's new podcast, “Not Yet Now,” premieres on November 19. Check it out:

      <title>Ep 991 | Jase Wins Craziest Wager He’s Ever Made &amp; How Do We Know the Bible Is Valid?</title>
      <description>Jase recounts one of the craziest wagers he ever won, and he swears he didn’t even think about cheating. Al is excited about a recent discovery of ancient stone tablets in Israel, and Zach points out that the Bible has been historically proven accurate many times over, more so than any other book from antiquity. The guys focus on the struggle that inevitably comes in life with following Jesus, but even that shouldn’t keep us from sharing Jesus with passion.

In this episode: Colossians 1; Colossians 2; Luke 13, verse 24; John 18, verse 36; Philippians 1, verse 27; Hebrews 12, verse 1; 1 Timothy 6, verses 11-12; Philemon 1, verse 6

      <title>Ep 990 | Jase Can’t Prove He’s Not a Robot &amp; Phil’s Reaction to Kids Operating a Band Saw</title>
      <description>Jase struggles to prove to a machine that he’s not a bot, and he keeps a botanic secret from Missy every time she goes out of town. Zach points out one major flaw in the Robertson family for generations, but Al insists they’re turning it around. Jase worries that child labor laws may have been broken when he was a kid building duck calls, and the guys illustrate that maturity doesn’t have to do with how long you’ve been a church member but how your heart responds to Jesus.

In this episode: Colossians 1, verses 15-21; 1 Corinthians 3, verses 15-21

      <title>Ep 983 | Jase Fesses Up to a Moment of Fast-Food Weakness &amp; Diddy Needs Jesus</title>
      <description>Jase confesses to recently doing something that he was able to quit almost 20 years ago, and it came back to bite him. Zach’s dubious burger-cooking hack leaves Jase and Al feeling skeptical, and everyone knows Phil’s burgers are the best anyway. The guys compare getting to know Jesus to being in a marriage, except that Jesus never lets us down like our spouses inevitably will. Al ponders the fate of rapper Diddy, who used to be famous for his lyrical skills but is now famous for sex trafficking and domestic abuse charges.

In this episode: Matthew 3, verse 15; Mark 1, verse 15; Luke 2, verse 49; Hebrews 3, verses 4-6; Genesis 2, verse 8

      <title>Ep 982 | Jase Drops a Hot Take That Will Ruffle Some Feathers &amp; Elmer Fudd Makes an Appearance</title>
      <description>Jase is on a roll between sparking controversy with church attendees, making fun of Zach’s fashion sense, and accurately comparing him to a famous cartoon character. Phil’s injury has prompted others to pick up the slack in baptisms at church, but it’s not quite the same. The guys discuss the nature of wisdom and how it’s described over time throughout the Bible. Zach offers a clue to the meaning of the biblical phrase “enemies in your mind.”

In this episode: Colossians 1, verses 15-20; Colossians 2; Proverbs 6, verse 16; Proverbs 7, verse 27; Proverbs 8, verses 22–23; Proverbs 21, verse 30; Ephesians 1, verse 4, John 2, verse 1

      <title>Ep 979 | Lisa Undergoes a Second Breast Cancer Surgery &amp; Jase Would Get a Pedicure for One Reason</title>
      <description>Jase refuses to believe in the merits of pedicures, even though Al sings their praises, and Lisa returns for an update on her second reconstructive surgery post-breast cancer. Jase compares the fake news of man-made gods to the good news of the gospel, and Jesus was the prototype for God becoming man as well as God living among men. Lisa relates her tale of desperation that led her to Christ and how she realized she’d made her husband the lord of her life instead of Jesus. 

In this episode: Colossians 1; Colossians 2; 1 Corinthians 8, verses 1-6

Jersey Joe insists that until one knows the love of Jesus, he can’t fully love others, and the guys pave the way for the upcoming discussion of the “armor of God” passages.

      <title>Ep 951 | Jase Is Fired Up About the Idea of Missy Running for Office &amp; Google Is Biblically Challenged</title>
      <description>Jase gets fired up imagining Missy running for office after her articulate and passionate speech about the American immigration system, and Al credits his and his brothers’ lives to Phil’s ability to make difficult decisions for their family. Jase’s foray into Google brings up troubling evidence that many people believe God doesn’t love everyone he created. The guys estimate that an earthly glimpse into hell is being left to our own devices to follow pleasure and worship ourselves.

In this episode: Ephesians 4; Romans 1, verses 18-20; Romans 9, verses 20-23; Romans 13, verses 8-14; John 8, verse 44

      <title>Ep 949 | Jase's Public Display of Manliness Backfires Spectacularly, Spiritual Con Men &amp; Cult Leaders</title>
      <description>Jase puts on his semi-annual display of rugged manliness for his wife and neighbors, only for it to backfire in a way he wasn’t expecting! Phil receives hopeful news that changes his outlook for the rest of the year, and Jase takes a leaf out of another country’s plan to get voters to actually show up at the polls during elections. The guys compare the traits of spiritual con men and cult leaders to the principles of the Bible to show just how far off base religious types can be if Jesus isn’t their center.

In this episode: Ephesians 4; James 3, verse 17; Ephesians 6, verses 1-4, 10-12; Hebrews 10, verses 14-29

      <title>Ep 944 | Phil Ends His Nap Early for Lynyrd Skynyrd, Jase Confesses a Crime &amp; Jep’s Gonna Be a Grandpa!</title>
      <description>Jase confesses a wrongdoing he did to Phil nearly 50 years ago that he’s held inside the whole time, and Jep announces his impending grandfather-hood!

      <title>Ep 942 | Jase Attempts to Be a Good Samaritan but Fails &amp; How Long Since Phil Looked in a Mirror?</title>
      <description>Jase’s lateness to the studio of course comes with a wild story including getting stuck in a drive-thru and an encounter with a woman running through the woods to get away from him. Phil wonders what any of it has to do with his cryptic notes or their Bible study, and the guys study the specific qualities of Ephesus that led Paul to write the Ephesian Christians their own letter. Zach highlights the irony of the power of love in a city that loved power, and what’s left of the old Roman gods?

      <title>Ep 941 | Phil Sticks His Foot in His Mouth with a Pro Athlete &amp; Jase Is Called Out for a Hat in Church</title>
      <description>Phil offers constructive criticism to a new hunting partner, only to find out later that he’s a World Series-winning baseball player. Jase heads to Tennessee to check on the extensive post-tornado cleanup at his home but wasn’t expecting to get called out at church for wearing a gospel hat in the service. The guys discuss the meaning of the phrase “fullness of God” and where it appears in various texts. Zach suggests that much of our anxiety comes from trying to assume power in our lives that doesn’t actually belong to us.

In this episode: Ephesians 2, verses 13-18; Ephesians 3, verse 19; Ephesians 4, verses 6-13; Romans 8, verse 26; 1 Corinthians 2, verse 12; Colossians 1, verses 19-23

      <title>Ep 921 | Phil Offers an Iffy Baptismal Guarantee &amp; Jase Missed the Point of ‘I Dream of Jeannie’</title>
      <description>Phil has one particular way to guarantee that no snakes or gators will interfere with his baptisms any more, but Jase isn’t so sure it’s foolproof. Al fondly looks back on shows like “I Dream of Jeannie” but Jase admits that the genie costume kept him distracted from the show’s deeper meaning. God isn’t a million miles away; he is near each of us, and the real battle isn’t trying to stay out of hell; it’s choosing to keep evil out of us.

      <itunes:summary>Phil has one particular way to guarantee that no snakes or gators will interfere with his baptisms any more, but Jase isn’t so sure it’s foolproof. Al fondly looks back on shows like “I Dream of Jeannie” but Jase admits that the genie costume kept him distracted from the show’s deeper meaning. God isn’t a million miles away; he is near each of us, and the real battle isn’t trying to stay out of hell; it’s choosing to keep evil out of us.

      <title>Ep 914 | Phil’s Wild-Eyed, Barefoot Run from the Law &amp; Jase Is Accused of Turning into Si</title>
      <description>Unashamed Nation has it out for Jase in the comments, accusing him of becoming more like rascally Uncle Si. Jase encountered a wild-eyed, barefoot man on the run as a child, though he wasn’t as afraid as you’d think. The guys explore the paradoxical concept of surrender to the Lord actually being triumph in the Lord, as well as the literal definition of hell and how Satan came to be there. Zach gives his argument as to why God gave Adam and Eve the rules he did and why they broke them.

In this episode: Genesis 3, verse 15; Hebrews 2, verses 9-22; Hebrews 9, verse 25; Colossians 1, verse 21; Colossians 2, verses 13-14

Zach gives his argument as to why God gave Adam and Eve the rules he did and why they broke them.</p><p><br></p><p>In this episode: Genesis 3, verse 15; Hebrews 2, verses 9-22; Hebrews 9, verse 25; Colossians 1, verse 21; Colossians 2, verses 13-14</p><p>--</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <description>Jase comes in hot to the studio after getting a ticket from a rookie cop for improperly wearing his seatbelt, even though Jase preached a full sermon to him about integrity from Hebrews during the stop.

Jase feels led to examine what the Bible says about “unintentional” sins, and the guys deal with the question of what and where is heaven, according to the Greek and Hebrew translations.

      <title>Ep 907 | Jase Claims Missy Avoids One Bodily Function at All Costs &amp; It’s NOT What You’d Guess</title>
      <description>Jase claims he’s only ever heard Missy make one particular sound once and only because he begged her to, though it’s probably not what you’re thinking! Phil might be a man of the woods, but there’s one thing he didn’t let a pandemic keep him from doing. The guys explore the concept of adoption in both Jewish culture and its significance to those who are baptized into Christ. Jase points out some scientific facts found in the Bible millennia before they were discovered by “modern” science.

In this episode: Ephesians 1, verses 3-14; Ephesians 4, verse 14; Romans 8, verse 28; 1 Corinthians 1, verse 23; Isaiah 40, verses 21-24; Deuteronomy 29, verse 29; Philippians 12, verses 2-4

      <title>Ep 906 | Young Jase Was Confronted with Beer, Drugs, Adult Content &amp; Saved by ‘Angels’ in the Woods</title>
      <description>Jase recalls the first time he was faced with a seriously sinful situation with his buddies in the woods but was miraculously saved by a surprise visit from the youth group. Phil fires up his Gospel voice after being inspired by studying Ephesians, and Al remembers the first time he ever felt the pull of sin and it changed everything. The guys examine the current cultural movement that says everyone has their own “truth” and compare it to truth as God defines it. Zach and Jase cover the various uses of the word “world” in the Bible and how that might change our perception of certain famous verses. 

In this episode: Ephesians 1, verses 1-14; 2 Thessalonians 2, verse 13; Galatians 6, verses 14-17; James 4, verse 4; 2 Corinthians 5, verses 15-19; John 17, verses 16-17; 1 John 5, verse 4

      <title>Ep 905 | Jase Sees a Bad Omen When He Misses Church &amp; Taking a Leashed Pig for a Walk?</title>
      <description>Jase misses church on purpose for a not-so-leisurely activity but takes it as a bad omen when he witnesses a man walking a pig on a leash. Phil is gifted a set of handmade fishing lures for display only, but Jase finds it upsetting to leave them on a shelf and not a fishing rod. The guys discuss the Greek meaning of the word “predestined” as it’s used by Paul, and Zach and Jase differ slightly on their emphasis of collective and personal atonement as described in Ephesians.

In this episode: Ephesians 1, verses 1-14, 22-23; Acts 2, verses 30-39; Romans 13, verse 8; Matthew 22, verse 3; Psalm 72, verse 17

      <title>Ep 904 | Phil Encourages Searching for Your Spiritual Gifts &amp; How the Bible Is a ‘Living’ Book</title>
      <description>Phil reveals why the lesson for his “Unashamed” Bible class at church never changes and encourages Christians old and new in their faith to find and use their spiritual gifts. Jase finds treasure in the podcast studio parking lot, which is interesting considering it’s in the middle of the woods! The guys put forth their own educated opinions on the overarching theme of Ephesians and how we’ve all contributed to the environment of sin that we live in. Jase realizes that no one can ever grasp every truth of the Bible since it was written by God, but our understanding of it can evolve as we grow and learn. 

In this episode: Ephesians 1, verse 17; Ephesians 2, verses 19-22; Romans 7, verses 18-24; 2 Corinthians 5, verses 1-15; Genesis 1, verse 28; Exodus 19, verses 4-6

      <description>Jase is surprised to find himself loving a recent George Clooney-directed movie, which leads Al to point out some of the dangerous, if useful, skills that Phil taught his boys when they were young. Jase solves a biblical mystery Phil proposed in the previous episode. The guys set up their continuing study of Ephesians by setting the stage with similar verses from Colossians and Romans to support their interpretation of Jesus as the fulfillment of all law, prophecy, needs, and salvation.

In this episode: Ephesians 3, verses 20-21; Ephesians 4; Ephesians 5, verse 5; Hebrews 7, verse 16; Colossians 1, verse 9; Colossians 2, verses 2-20; Romans 5, verses 12-17

      <title>Ep 902 | Phil &amp; Miss Kay’s Record-Holding ‘Duck Dynasty’ Wedding &amp; Jase Buys a Bouncy House! </title>
      <description>Phil feels as if he’s attending a wedding every week with so many of his progeny getting married. Zach points out that Phil &amp; Miss Kay’s wedding episode of “Duck Dynasty” is still the most viewed nonfiction cable series episode of all time, and Jase buys a bouncy house, though bouncing is the least fun thing about it. The guys discuss unification as a theme that runs throughout the entire Bible and how the Tower of Babel fiasco was rectified through Jesus. Zach and Jase pull references to Jesus from all over the Bible faster than they can even write them down.

In this episode: Ephesians 1-3; Isaiah 2; Isaiah 9, verse 6; Isaiah 19, verses 16-22; Zechariah 14, verse 16; Hosea 2, verse 23; Matthew 3, verse 15; Matthew 3, verse 15; John 3, verse 27; Mark 1, verse 15

      <title>Ep 901 | Phil Went for Two Years Without Shoes &amp; What Does the Bible Say about Dinosaurs?</title>
      <description>Phil recalls going shoeless for multiple years back in his pre-Jesus days, and his sons think that’s one of the things that contributed to his living legend. Jase discovers multiple scriptural references to mythical creatures, but what do they mean? The guys point out the difference between man and animals, though there are similarities, too. Zach and Jase begin to tackle the prickly subjects of predestination, original sin, and why humans use their God-given gifts to create evil.

In this episode: Ephesians 1, verses 1-11; Romans 1, verses 18-32; Romans 7, verse 9; John 10, verses 14-18

      <title>Ep 895 | Phil Needs a Helping Hand in the Baptistry &amp; Drinking Chuck Norris’ Sweat Is Good for You!?</title>
      <description>Phil required a hand in the baptistry recently, but Jase thinks it’s a cool approach to the task. Al feels a little “frisky” after drinking Chuck Norris’ brand of water, and the guys can’t resist some classic Chuck Norris jokes. The guys ponder the difference between the indwelling of the Holy Spirit and the pouring out of the Holy Spirit, and a scriptural reference to a miraculous handkerchief gets Jase giggling over the idea. Zach encourages people to examine their lives for evidence of Jesus living in their hearts.

In this episode: Acts 18-20; Hebrews 9, verses 27-28; Hebrews 12, verse 1; Matthew 3, verses 7-12; Acts 2, verse 33; Acts 10, verse 44; 1 Corinthians 1, verses 13-17; 1 Corinthians 12, verses 12-29

      <description>Jase’s famous line was “stolen” by Arnold and General MacArthur, though it’s obvious that it originated with Jesus. Jase gets sucked into a kids’ movie thanks to the U2 soundtrack, and Phil’s early duck-call business makes the perfect illustration for a debate about salvation. The guys encourage self-examination in everyone to see whether Jesus lives in their hearts, and Zach describes the “empty hands of faith.”

      <title>Ep 887 | Jase Took a Beating for His Faith &amp; Later Baptized His Attacker</title>
      <description>Jase gives the details on the time during his youth when he was beaten up for going to a Bible study at a young woman’s house, but mere weeks later he had befriended and baptized his attacker. Phil supposes that’s what you get when you get too close to someone else’s girlfriend, and Zach pokes fun at Jase's fabled “right hand of fellowship.” The guys discuss the tactics used by the Romans and Jewish leaders to rid themselves of Christians, the importance of the temple as a touchstone in Jewish history, and why that mindset had to change with Jesus’ arrival. 

In this episode: Acts 17; Psalm 89, verses 3-4 &amp; 35-37; 1 Thessalonians 2; 2 Thessalonians 2, verses 1-4; 1 Kings 8, verses 22-27; Revelation 21, verses 22-7

      <title>Ep 886 | Miss Kay Literally Lights Up Phil’s Life &amp; Jase Almost Throws Hands in Preaching School</title>
      <description>Phil gets Miss Kay back at home a couple of days a week, and he didn’t realize how much he missed her until now! Jase is a temporary bachelor while Missy is traveling, but he’s able to see the silver lining. Al recounts some of the biggest jams Jase got himself into during preaching school, like offending his instructors from the pulpit and aggressively offering another student the “right hand of fellowship.” The guys discuss the relationship between God and science, including the way Paul used reason to grow the church, how modern people argue for or against science as evidence of God, and what exactly can or can’t be proven scientifically.

In this episode: Acts 17; Hebrews 3, verses 4-6

      <title>Ep 883 | Jase Is Disturbed by Weird Things People Eat &amp; Phil Disses a New Jersey Delicacy</title>
      <description>Phil experiences the wondrous culinary journey of Italian and Cajun fusion, but there’s one New Jersey staple that the guys are not so sure about. Jase has had some memorable and queasy moments with guests at the dinner table, and the guys consider how Phil’s life changed from being full of R-rated scenes to being full of grace and devotion. Zach compares today’s society to that of ancient Greece and Rome and finds that even our liberal culture would be embarrassed by what went on then. The guys emphasize the need for a spirit of confession among church leaders and what “heaven” actually means.

In this episode: 1 John 2, verse 1; Romans 8, verse 34; Hebrews 1, verse 3; Hebrews 4; Hebrews 9, verses 24-26; Hebrews 10, verses 12-14; Hebrews 12, verse 12

A medical emergency during Al’s latest sermon might be construed as spiritual warfare, which leads the guys to discuss God’s communication style with us in modern times versus how it was done in the days of the early church.

      <title>Ep 881 | Phil Gives His Sons Something to Look Forward to in Old Age &amp; Motorcycle Gangs for Jesus?</title>
      <description>Phil’s down-home advice to Al when he started out in ministry proved to be one of the most useful things for his preaching career, and Jase is intimidated by a towering, leather-clad biker until they realize they both love Jesus. The guys examine some of the finer points of the ministry of the early church, including how to treat, confront, and disagree with others in ministry. Al is touched by the relationship between Paul and Timothy as it reminds him of his own mentor.

      <description>Jase is in the mood to argue with Zach and three strangers who publicly confronted him with disagreements about the Bible. Phil only has one reply to all the disputes, and the guys deeply discuss their personal understanding of the Holy Trinity, how it functions, and what it means to us.

      <title>Ep 878 | Phil’s Chubby Hunting Buddies Sink His Boat &amp; Jase Gets Injured Herding Goats</title>
      <description>Phil wastes no time handing out blame when his hunting buddies prove to be too heavy for his boat, and Jase throws his back out chasing and being dragged around by a goat in the woods! Al also sustains a back injury doing something much less entertaining, and the reason for the Robertsons’ thick skin comes to the foreground. The guys discuss whether or not all angels are good angels, taking a college midterm guided solely by the Holy Spirit, and the reason some people think Acts chapters 13 and 14 apply to contemporary culture.

In this episode: Acts 13; Acts 20, verses 25-27; Colossians 2, verses 6-15; Galatians 1, verses 6-9; John 14

      <title>Ep 877 | Jase Refuses to Join Missy’s Hair-Raising Adventure &amp; How to Hunt Gators for TV</title>
      <description>Jase isn’t much of a thrill-seeker like Missy’s latest adventure, but he and Phil recall their closest encounters with dangerous reptiles and how they managed to get away unscathed. Jase relays the dangers of hunting gators with a television crew in tow. The guys consider that the gospel should perhaps be expanded to include one more tenet, as well as the mechanics of Jesus’ death and Paul’s establishment of the church at Antioch before his expulsion from the city.

In this episode: Acts 13; Romans 8, verse 11; Mark 1, verse 14; Acts 2, verse 24; Psalm 16, verse 9

      <title>Ep 876 | Jase Puffs Up with Missy’s Praise of His Manliness &amp; Bravery During a Storm</title>
      <description>Jase performs a dangerous task when his house is nearly flooded, and Missy was so impressed she couldn’t help but brag about him. Phil examines the changes in the church during the first century, and Zach compares many of those themes to what our modern church is going through. Al uncovers a flattering article about the Robertson family and how their love for Jesus is sorely needed at this moment in time. And the guys use a biblical example to explain why the “us versus them” mindset can always come back to haunt you.

In this episode: Acts 13; Ezekiel 18, verse 32; 2 Peter 3, verse 9; Hebrews 8, verse 8; Hebrews 12, verse 22; Isaiah 55, verse 5; Isaiah 60, verse 3; Jeremiah 16, verses 19-21

      <title>Ep 874 | Missy Tells Jase Not to Come Home After His Sermon &amp; Impersonating Godwin</title>
      <description>Jase is instructed by Missy not to come home after his most recent sermon or he’d find a house full of women, and the guys perform their hilarious Godwin impersonations. Al reveals the unique way Phil was able to set Godwin up for coming to Jesus over decades, and a power failure throws a wrench in the episode, but the guys and producer Madi roll with the punches. Jase recalls the only times he was ever in a bar when he actually put on a “disguise” so he wouldn’t be recognized. The guys rehash Jase’s sermon on the book of Hebrews and its one central theme.

      <description>Phil warns against messing with Jesus or his angels as King Herod did just before he was struck down and suffered an agonizing death. Jase gets called up to the pulpit big leagues to preach in place of Larry Bowles, and a holy curse that actually worked makes Jase scratch his head. The guys offer clarification of Saul’s “name change” that really wasn’t a name change and discuss the shift of the Christian church outreach from Jerusalem to Antioch.

In this episode: Acts 12, Acts 13, 1 John 2, verse 2; John 1, verse 1; 1 Corinthians 16, verse 22

Jase floats a new theory about the reason for “clusters” of miracles, and the guys study the gruesome ends of some powerful people in Jesus’ time.

      <title>Ep 860 | Phil Has a Cheeky Answer to His Wannabe Haters &amp; Willie Fulfills a Prophecy</title>
      <description>Phil never reads the comments, but he’s got a hilarious response to why he never feels the negativity. Zach taunted Willie years ago, but it came back to bite him — hard! Jase is afraid he might have eaten a record-holding fish, and it turns out Phil has something big in common with Paul. The guys debate the motivations for Paul to give up his powerful position among the Pharisees and his focus on his own guilt and the grace of God.

In this episode: Acts 9; Ephesians 4, verses 1-10; Galatians 1, verses 8-24; Galatians 2, verses 19-20

      <title>Ep 859 | How Jase Adopted His Daughter &amp; Phil Raises an Eyebrow at His Son’s ‘Crazy’ Africa Trip</title>
      <description>Phil is touched by the bravery of African missionaries but amused by the ill-advised trip his son took to visit them. Jase recalls how his daughter, Karina, joined his family, and the guys delve into the conversion of Saul, a persecutor of Christians, into Paul the apostle. Al and Jase point back to two other stories in the Old Testament where the Israelites were righteously called to oppose idolatry. The guys agree that sincerity in the Holy Spirit is what draws people to Christ more than educated words.

In this episode: Acts 9; John 14, verse 6; Ezekiel 1, verses 26-28; Philippians 3, verses 3-9; Revelation 1, verses 12-17; Numbers 25, verses 1-13; 1 Kings 18, verse 4

      <title>Ep 858 | Phil Sneaks Up on His New Bidet &amp; Jase Doesn’t Believe In ‘Enhanced’ Bathroom Experiences</title>
      <description>Phil gets a new piece of bathroom hardware he’s immediately suspicious of, but Jase finds the whole mental picture hilarious. Jase recalls Rucker’s hiring at Duck Commander, even though the first thing he said during his interview was “I’m a convicted felon.” The guys conclude that the best way to stay away from sin is to spend your time chasing Jesus and use the evidence from the story about Philip to propose ideas about the urgency of baptism.

In this episode: Acts 8; 1 Peter 2, verse 1; Jonah 1, verses 1-3; 2 Corinthians 5; 2 Corinthians 6, verse 1

      <title>Ep 856 | Jase Witnesses a ‘Miracle,’ but Phil Doesn’t Think It Counts</title>
      <description>Jase gives an example from his own life as evidence of the overuse of the word “miraculous,” even though he did actually pull off something pretty amazing. Phil is unconvinced by Jase’s achievement, though! The guys explore the ramifications of Stephen’s death and the spreading of Christianity outward from Jerusalem into the world. They introduce Saul of Tarsus, a persecutor of Christians who eventually becomes Paul the apostle and author of much of the New Testament.

In this episode: Acts 8; Psalm 80; Jude 1, verse 9; Galatians 1, verse 13; Philippians 3, verse 6; 1 Timothy 1, verse 13

      <title>Ep 851 | Missy Spends a Few Nights in the Hospital with Miss Kay &amp; the Best Money Jase Ever Spent</title>
      <description>Jase admits that there are a few checks he’s written in the past that didn’t bother him at all, and Miss Kay gets a cheerful companion when Missy spends a few nights in the hospital with her. Phil is wary of how many scammers there are out there, and the guys discuss the fate of Ananias and Sapphira, two members of the church who lied and stole from God. Zach points out that when the church really works in community, it’s more like Jesus’ Kingdom instead of a political organization.

      <title>Ep 850 | Miss Kay Is in the Hospital Again &amp; Why the Robertsons Talk About Death So Much</title>
      <description>Phil’s only link to the outside world leaves him feeling sorrowful but more determined than ever to share Jesus. Jase’s link to the greater world seems to be the local grocery store. Miss Kay's hospitalization leaves Phil feeling lonely, and Zach finds an uplifting reason that the Robertsons have so little aversion to discussing death. The guys deliberate the reason that Christianity seems to flourish during difficulty, such as during the Roman Empire, and how oppression emboldens the followers of Jesus.

In this episode: Acts 4, verses 23-37; Acts 17, verse 27; John 10, verses 10-18; Matthew 18, verses 26-28

      <title>Ep 849 | Missy Gives Up Her Spa Appointment to Jase &amp; He Totally Embarrasses Himself</title>
      <description>Jase’s age and physical demands cause him to need an emergency spa appointment, and he might never be the same again. The guys dig deep into their memory banks for a song and join up for a little harmonizing. Phil isn’t too impressed, though Zach thinks they could really go places. The guys investigate the eternal union with Jesus as the reward for living a life following him and why people tend to prefer their own autonomy to submission to God.

In this episode: Acts 4; Luke 20, verses 9-19; 2 Corinthians 4, verse 16

The guys are excited about today’s premiere of their brand-new show, “Cooking with the Robertsons,” in which Phil gives a step-by-step guide to his famous duck gumbo recipe!

      <title>Ep 824 | Jase Gets an Ego Boost When Missy Sings His Praises to a Stranger &amp; Phil Gets Stood Up</title>
      <description>Burly shows that the woods aren’t always a safe place even for seasoned hunters, and Phil leaves a shindig early to get to a hunt — only to be left behind. Jase gives up the first bird jewelry of the season to a novice, but Missy’s praise of him in the grocery store soothes his ego. The guys explore the agony of Jesus on the night of his arrest, as well as multiple accounts of his confrontation with Judas in the garden of Gethsemane and at the last supper.

In this episode: Luke 22, verses 39-52; Matthew 28, verses 18-20; Matthew 26, verses 21-25; Mark 16, verse 16; Romans 15, verses 4-7

      <title>Ep 813 | Jase Is Trapped in a Nightmare of Matchy PJs &amp; His Gift for Missy Totally Backfires</title>
      <description>Phil and Miss Kay are finally passing the torch of their traditions to the younger Robertson generations, who are happy to take up the mantle! Jase gets a lesson in tactfulness from all the shopping that Missy does during the holidays, though Jase just gets his family the same gift for every occasion. The guys consider the example that Jesus sets of “true religion” by helping the poor, dirty, and sick rather than giving the superficial show of faith that the Jewish leaders of his day presented.

In this episode: Luke 20, verses 41-47; Romans 1, verse 5; Philippians 3, verses 18-21; 1 Corinthians 15

The guys dive into the power structure of Israel during Jesus’ time and its similarities to the power structures of the modern world.

In this episode: Luke 20, verses 1-28; Luke 6, verses 20-26; Hebrews 12, verse 2; Acts 7, verse 51; Acts 4, verse 12; John 14, verse 6

      <title>Ep 807 | Jase Faces Down Science with Donkey Facts &amp; Phil Notices an Ugly Trend with His Duckmen</title>
      <description>There’s an upsetting trend that’s swept the guys’ duck-hunting crew, and Phil and Jase are over it. Jase goes to the mat with science over the significance of a donkey’s markings, and Phil learns something “new” about the subject. The guys contemplate the human need to create our own plans for our lives and our tendency to be upset when God doesn’t abide by them. Al feels reassured by the fact that even the greatest heroes of the Bible still had moments when they needed clarity. 

In this episode: Luke 19, verses 28-38; Ephesians 2, verses 19-22; John 2, verses 18-22; 1 Timothy 3, verses 14-15

Phil is amused by Jase’s list of “kings,” and the guys discuss the kingship aspect of Jesus and why America seems to struggle with the concept.

      <title>Ep 785 | Phil Is Open to Suggestions for ‘The Blind’ Sequel &amp; Jase Gets Schooled by His Own Son</title>
      <description>After many weird forays into his own mind, Jase finally comes up with a movie idea that just might work! Zach gets roasted by Willie and Jase separately, and Jase reveals a time he was stunned into silence by his son’s rebuke. The guys explore the idea of God as a father figure and the family design that he built for humanity. Then they look at prayer and the purpose it serves in human lives, as well as the debate around the “right” way to pray.

In this episode: Luke 18, verses 1-8; Luke 11, verses 1-13; Romans 8, verse 26; Psalm 103; John 17, verse 17

      <title>Ep 782 | Jase Gets Punished for a Good Deed &amp; an ‘Unashamed’ Fan Saves the Day!</title>
      <description>Jase has returned from recent travels with fresh stories of his own feats of derring-do, though for all his efforts, he’s rebuffed by airline staff and deemed by Phil to be an unfavorable travel companion. Zach is saved by an "Unashamed" fan in the middle of nowhere, and the guys get into a fiery discussion about the “third temple” and the coming of the Lord. The guys delve into the rich history of those who’ve divined the end of days and what scripture has to say about the once and future kingdom of Jesus.

In this episode: Luke 17, verses 20-37; Exodus 25, verse 8; Matthew 24; Daniel 7; Galatians 3, verses 15-28; 1 Kings 6, verses 11-14; Hebrews 3, verse 6; Matthew 9, verse 25

      <title>Ep 781 | Phil Breaks the Church Dress Code &amp; How ‘Duck Dynasty’ Is Today's ‘Andy Griffith’</title>
      <description>Phil and the guys are joined by someone whom they’ve inspired to speak out about Jesus: country singer, songwriter, and internet sensation Buddy Brown and his wife, Bootsy. Phil cracks wise about his reputation for bucking the dress code wherever he goes, and Al draws a line between the Robertson family as seen in “The Blind” and the Robertson family of today. Buddy encourages the next generation to stand up for faith and backwoods wisdom. The guys, Buddy, and Bootsy lament the way that modern entertainment tries to shut out faith-based content.

      <title>Ep 763 | Phil Has Such a Great Morning, He Can’t Help but Sing &amp; Jase Confronts Cookie Thieves</title>
      <description>After a week and a half of waiting, a good hunt results in Phil breaking out in song. Jase is outraged when he’s robbed of a delicious treat by a camera crew, though there is an opportunity for growth in the situation.

The guys conclude that making their wives happy with their yards is worth the price! The guys discuss the “Good Samaritan” parable and why it made such waves during that time. Jase is glad that God is long-suffering, since humans tend to struggle with loving their neighbors.

      <title>Ep 734 | Phil’s Message for ‘Enemies of the Cross’ &amp; Jase’s Impression of the Sleepy Disciples</title>
      <description>Phil identifies the “enemies of the cross” and ominously predicts what will happen to them at the end of days. Jase can’t believe the poor behavior of the disciples at a momentous Biblical event, and his impersonation of them cracks up the guys. Zach reveals the arguments that usually don’t work for converting people and the one that works every time, in its own time. The guys discuss Abraham’s covenant with God from the book of Genesis and how it relates to the misconceptions of the Kingdom that threw Jesus’ contemporaries for a loop. 

In this episode: Luke 9, verses 28-36; Philippians 3, verse 18; Romans 1, verse 16; Genesis chapter 15

      <title>Ep 733 | Phil Manipulates Jase into a 3-Hour Wild Goose Chase &amp; Jase’s Lottery Confession </title>
      <description>Jase owns up to his lottery experience, and even though he didn’t win, it sure is fun to think about what he’d do with the winnings! Phil manipulated Jase into a three-hour biblical wild goose chase at 9 o’clock at night. Apparently, mind games are something he’s made a habit of playing throughout his sons’ lives! The guys and guest Larry Bowles engage in a lively discussion of historical accounts that actually confirm, rather than disprove, the Bible. Larry’s special knowledge of antiquated biblical practices and events sheds light on how the past informs the present. 

In this episode: Luke 9, verses 43-56

      <description>A party on Willie’s patio reveals new developments in the war that he and Jase are waging over Willie’s stocked pond. Phil can only shake his head at the shenanigans of his sons, but Jase feels like he’s the scapegoat in every family situation.

      <title>Ep 726 | Jase Calls Out Spiritual Warfare Plaguing ‘Sound of Freedom’ &amp; the Best Money Phil’s Spent</title>
      <description>Jase and Al saw “Sound of Freedom” and can’t wait to tell everyone about it. Phil, of course, hasn’t yet ventured to the movie theater to see it. While Jase recommends “Sound of Freedom,” he has a bone to pick with the “Mission: Impossible” franchise. The guys dive into a story from Luke 8 about a woman who was healed merely by touching the hem of Jesus’ cloak. Al gives some context about what Jesus was doing in that place at that time, and Phil draws a conclusion based on his own experience with women about how long this process likely took. 

In this episode: Luke 8, verses 40-56; Romans 1, verse 31; Hebrews 11, verse 6; Ephesians 4, verses 18-19

      <title>Ep 715 | Jase Gets Himself into a Pickle Telling Missy Not to Cry &amp; His Future as a Movie Mogul?</title>
      <description>Jase is in the hot seat with his buddies and his wife after giving some well-intentioned but unwise advice. Amazingly, Jesus gave the same advice in Luke 7, but with much better results. Phil and Al are impressed by the actress playing Miss Kay in "The Blind" and a particular trait she managed to capture in her performance. Jase is excited that Dallas Jenkins, creator of "The Chosen," might actually take his advice on a future movie project! The guys explore the significance of all the resurrection miracles that take place in Luke, the Gospels, and the Old Testament. 

In this episode: Luke 7; Acts 10; Mark 15, verse 39; Luke 9, verse 22

      <title>Ep 714 | Phil’s Dinner Table Ministry &amp; the Only Fast Food the Robertsons Eat</title>
      <description>Jase thinks America’s downward spiral can be summed up by one interaction at a fast-food joint.

The guys explore the importance of food during Jesus’ ministry and contemporary ministry. Al leads the discussion about the Roman centurion in Luke 7 and how the mindset of the Jewish clergy clouded their judgment about their country’s occupation by Rome.

      <title>Ep 713 | Jase’s Run-in with a Toxic Tree While Froggin’ &amp; His First Time Eating a Swamp Delicacy</title>
      <description>The guys can’t help telling tales about all the swamp creatures they love to eat, plus a new one that Jase was recently exposed to. Jase recalls a painful frog hunt that ended with him being physically ill, and Phil traces a duck back to a faraway place that Jase recently visited. The guys study a text from Luke about the pain and labor involved in producing good fruit, which leads to some fascinating real-life illustrations from their own pasts. Jase and Zach discuss the importance of building a life upon the firm foundation of Jesus, instead of the shifting sands of the world. 

In this episode: Luke 6, verses 43-45; Romans 8, verse 12; Matthew 12, verse 36; James 1, verses 23-25

      <title>Ep 709 | Jase Got Leeches in the WORST Place &amp; Missy Says NO WAY to Lending a Hand!</title>
      <description>Al’s list of professions that no longer exist leads Jase to tell a private but appalling story about the last time he encountered leeches. Even Missy was out on that one! Phil reckons that one thing gets stolen from him more than anything else, though after studying Jesus’ reaction to injustice, Phil is trying to make the best of it. The guys study the response of Jesus to suffering persecution and injustice and how we should approach such a subject, even though it can be really difficult. 

In this episode: Luke 6 verses 27-42; John 18 verses 19-23; Matthew 7 verses 3-5; 1 Corinthians 5 verses 9-13

      <title>Ep 703 | Uncle Si Thinks He’s About to Get Rich &amp; Jase’s Life Choice That Drove Missy CRAZY!</title>
      <description>The guys congratulate Jase on the release of the new season of "Duck Family Treasure"! Uncle Si thinks the whole thing was his idea, of course. Jase’s laid-back attitude made him an excellent negotiator back when he worked for Duck Commander. That same attitude led him to make a choice that Missy spent most of their marriage frustrated over! The guys cover the “blessings and woes” section of the book of Luke. Phil believes Jesus was the perfect model for true success, and Jase gives a biblical definition of the word “tolerance.” Plus, where’s the Bible’s happy ending?!

In this episode: Luke 6, verses 17-49; Daniel 5; Galatians 6, verse 14

      <title>Ep 702 | Phil Used to Pilfer Food from His Neighbors &amp; Jase &amp; Missy’s Biggest Argument Ever</title>
      <description>Phil and Jase have a history of eating whatever they come across in the woods, whether it belongs to them or not! Luckily for them, it has turned out all right so far. While watching a college baseball game, Jase is reminded of one of the biggest arguments he and Missy ever got into … over baby names! The guys discuss the Pharisees’ reaction to Jesus disregarding the Sabbath, and Al urges Christians to be less judgmental of each other, especially of new Christians. The guys conclude that obedience to a law isn’t as important as what’s in a person’s heart.

In this episode: Luke 6, verses 1-19

      <title>Ep 698 | Phil &amp; Miss Kay’s Midnight Drag Racing Encounter &amp; Jase Gets Grossed Out Big-Time</title>
      <description>Phil and Miss Kay recently had an unfortunate experience with some drag racing buffoons late at night. But they both claim to be the hero of the story! Who do you believe? Jase is totally repulsed by what a nurse pulled out of Phil’s ear, but at least he can hear better! Phil, Miss Kay, Al, and Lisa witness an outlandish conveyance in Amish country at an event in Ohio. The guys discuss those Al calls “The Untouchables” in Luke 5: lepers, paraplegics, and tax collectors. Al and Jase explore what a big deal it was in Jewish society for Jesus to actually touch and spend time with such people. 

 In this episode: Luke 5, verses 12-31

      <title>Ep 697 | Phil Has Seen ‘Dumb &amp; Dumber’ Apparently &amp; Jase’s Dream Turned Movie Idea</title>
      <description>Phil’s movie-watching career is apparently way more varied than anyone knew, based on the quote he uses. Jase has a weird dream that he thinks would make a great movie and wonders how different life would be if people had more than two arms. Al recounts a strange and gross thing he used to do while sleepwalking. The guys discuss physical and spiritual leprosy and which one is more damaging to the spirit. Al gives credit where it’s due when talking about the four friends in Luke 5 who went above and beyond for their paralyzed friend. The guys compare Peter’s response to Jesus to the response of the only leper who thanked Jesus for his healing.

In this Episode: Luke 5, verses 17-26; Luke 6, verses 17-26; Luke 17, verses 11-19

      <title>Ep 688 | Phil’s ‘Stupid Human Trick,’ Jase &amp; Jep’s Sweaty Trip to the Middle of Nowhere</title>
      <description>Phil’s truck bears the evidence of his dodgy lumberjack techniques, and he’s lucky to still be here! Jase just got back from an unexpectedly sweaty, uncomfortable trip with Jep and his new hybrid truck. Poor Jep came home with his tail between his legs! The guys go over several more demon possession stories from Luke and the rest of the Bible and discuss whether perhaps Jesus’ life and death changed something about the supernatural world. Phil wonders why disease and misery are still so widespread if so many people believe science holds all the answers.

        <![CDATA[<p>Phil remembers a visit to the most depressing place he’s ever been, and Jase peeks behind the curtain of movie-making magic. The guys talk about Jesus’ first sermon, the one that nearly got him killed on the spot. Jase and Al take a look back in the Old Testament to a couple of stories that are easy to miss, but hold great significance to Jesus. The guys also ponder the reasons Jesus may not have been welcome in his own hometown. <strong>Last chance: Vote for Unashamed as K-LOVE's podcast of the year by FRIDAY 5/26: </strong><a href="https://www.klovefanawards.com/vote"><strong>https://www.klovefanawards.com/vote</strong></a></p><p><br></p><p>In this episode: Luke 4, verses 14-30; 1 Kings 17; 2 Kings 5; Isaiah 61, verses 1-18</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://philmerch.com/">https://philmerch.com</a> – Shop now for your “Unashamed” mugs, shirts, hats &amp; hoodies!</p><p><br></p><p>"The Blind" hits theaters on 9/28/23.

      <title>Ep 685 | Phil’s Redneck Rebuke of Satan &amp; Jase Clearly Watches a Lot of Scary Movies</title>
      <description>Phil’s got something not-so-nice to say to the evil one, and Jase’s knowledge of scary movies applies quite well to the subject matter of demons. The guys explore scriptural clues that tell us more about what Satan’s powers might actually be, while Jase cautions against over-spiritualizing life’s circumstances. Al uses biblical text to guess how Jesus himself felt about demons during his ministry on Earth. 

In this episode: Luke 3, verse 21 through Luke 4, verse 13; James 1, verse 13; Hebrews 2, verse 14; 2 Corinthians 11, verse 13

      <title>Ep 626 | Jase's Run-In with an Inebriated Fan in the Middle of Nowhere &amp; Phil's Favorite Duck Recipe</title>
      <description>Phil, Jase, and the guys are full of excitement with the end of duck season and Jase’s filming of the new season of "Duck Family Treasure." Jase waits impatiently for news from his crack squad of dogs and men who are out searching for a prize. Phil couldn’t hack it for the last day of duck season, so he spent the day cooking – and is willing to part with his treasured recipe! Jase encounters an intoxicated fan and handles it pretty well, in his opinion. The scripture leads the guys to exploring the community of God and how it is irreplaceable, yet as flawed as its members are. 

In this episode: 1 Peter 2, verses 4-12; Hebrews 7; Acts 10, verse 13

      <title>Ep 624 | Phil Defends His Sister at a Bar &amp; Jase Once Upset an Entire Bible Class</title>
      <description>Phil’s sister Jan brought a preacher to a bar to try to save him before he was ready to listen – and it didn’t go well! Jase once made an ill-conceived illustration while teaching that left everyone in the room reeling! The guys delve deep into the word of God and posit that we must all be broken, like Phil was, before we can be remade as God sees us. Guest Larry Bowles ventures a guess as to why the Israelites were made to wander the desert for 40 years when the journey could actually have been much shorter.

In this episode: In this episode: 1 Peter 1, verse 22 - 1 Peter 2, verse 3

      <title>Ep 616 | Phil &amp; Miss Kay's Free-Range Parenting &amp; Why Jase Won't Attend High School Reunions</title>
      <description>Jase has a very good reason for never attending high school reunions. Phil and Miss Kay were some of the original free-range parents, and Jase and Al share childhood stories of their free-range adventures. Zach and Jase emphasize the role women played in being witness to the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. Zach shares about the times he struggled with doubt in his faith — but what he kept coming back to was the awesomeness of God choosing to accomplish what he did in a way no one would have predicted. And Jase remembers his own faith journey, when church seemed boring, but when he heard the first sermon Phil ever preached — "The Bad News and the Good News" — he decided to consider the Gospel, and that changed his life. 
In this episode: Mark 16.

      <title>Ep 614 | Jase Calls Out the Robertsons' Apostle Problem &amp; Where Did Jesus Go When He Died?</title>
      <description>Jase and Al emphasize what a powerful moment it was for Jesus to be taking care of his mother even as he hung on the cross, dying. Jase says Peter reminds him of many Robertson family members in that they all "speak first, deal with consequences later." Phil can't believe the disciples still didn't believe that Jesus would rise from the dead, but Jase defends their lack of faith. Jase makes the point that a group of women watched Jesus die, were eyewitnesses to his burial, and then were the first to see his resurrected body — and yet because they were women, would not be able to testify in a court of law. Plus, where did Jesus go for the three days after he died, before his resurrection?

      <title>Ep 613 | Jase Is Judging His Brother Hard for What He Did in Church &amp; Missy Keeps Jase in CHECK </title>
      <description>Jase couldn't believe his not-exactly-gifted-in-singing brother would stand up and sing for the whole congregation in church, but Phil says he won't judge anyone on his singing ability. Missy keeps Jase in check when he thinks his singing is sounding album-ready. And digging more into Mark 15, the guys discuss the road to Calvary, Jesus' trial, and how the one thief realized — at the very last opportunity — that he needed to follow Jesus and he did. Phil reminds us that each of us has that moment in our lives when we choose whether or not to follow the Lord. And how do you make the facts about Jesus real and personal when you tell others about him?

      <title>Ep 612 | Phil &amp; Jase Have the Same Problem &amp; It INFURIATES Missy &amp; a Tornado Warning in West Monroe</title>
      <description>Phil and Jase tragically share the same, er, recollection problem. And for that, they're on Missy's list. Phil doesn't know why his family calls him the different names they do. Jase has the ultimate New Year's resolution for anyone. Plus, when a tornado warning hit West Monroe, how did Phil and Miss Kay and Jase and Missy respond? And why does it take a moment like Damar Hamlin's terrifying cardiac event on the football field to remind ALL of us that life is short and we need to be thinking about eternal life? And a deeper study of Jesus' death on the cross.

      <itunes:summary>Phil and Jase tragically share the same, er, recollection problem. And for that, they're on Missy's list. Phil doesn't know why his family calls him the different names they do. Jase has the ultimate New Year's resolution for anyone. Plus, when a tornado warning hit West Monroe, how did Phil and Miss Kay and Jase and Missy respond? And why does it take a moment like Damar Hamlin's terrifying cardiac event on the football field to remind ALL of us that life is short and we need to be thinking about eternal life? And a deeper study of Jesus' death on the cross.

      <title>Ep 611 | Jase DELETED Uncle Si from His Phone &amp; Phil Is Skeptical of Zach's Absence</title>
      <description>Jase and Phil are both a little skeptical of Zach's reason for not being on the podcast today: "What type of jungle could he be in where there's no cell service?" Phil doesn't want anyone to miss the women who surrounded Jesus as he ministered to them and to the crowds or the important role they played in the retelling of his death and resurrection. Phil and Jase talk about why it's important to have four different accounts of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection in the Gospels. Plus, where did the dream come from that Pilate's wife experienced? And did Pilate fully understand what was happening during Jesus' trial? Jase reminds us why you should never underestimate the confidence that can be communicated in silence — when Pilate asked Jesus a "trick" question, Jesus remained silent. Jase and Al wonder whether Pilate knew who Jesus was — or was just scared.

      <title>Ep 610 | Jase and Phil Were Scammed by the Best Prank EVER &amp; Missy Really Doesn't Like Cats</title>
      <description>The Robertson family Christmas was interrupted by the ultimate prank — but who did it? Jase describes what it was like trying to figure out who tricked them all, but isn't it incredible when an entire group of people can be duped by something that's not real? And continuing in the book of Mark, why did Judas kiss Jesus when he greeted him as he was betraying him? Jase reminds us that during the "trial" of Jesus, it was backward: WE should have been on trial, not God, the judge! And what a sham of a trial it was — Jesus didn't ever commit a crime!

      <title>Ep 609 | Phil Injures His Back AGAIN &amp; It's So Bad, He Can't Even Baptize People!</title>
      <description>Phil's suffering ANOTHER back injury, and it's so bad it prevented him from baptizing a man in his Sunday School class. Phil wonders why Christmas celebrations seem to only emphasize the birth of Jesus without focusing on why Jesus was born here on earth. The guys encourage us to consider that there are consequences to saying "no" to Jesus in our lives. Jase asks if you can cry under water! Plus, an in-depth look at Jesus on the cross, the sweating of blood, and the agony of his death.

      <title>Ep 583 | Jase Explains Why Grace Is a Verb &amp; Phil Has a Heartwarming Realization About Miss Kay</title>
      <description>Jase talks about how you can't know the person you just married until you have stayed married! Zach discusses the difference between intelligence and self-improvement and the tools to adjust yourself by letting God love you through people. Jase says that you will have to be prepared to give and receive grace with your spouse daily, because the reality of day-to-day life is very different from the marketing you do to attract a spouse. Al calls marriage one of the greatest gifts God gave humans and illustrates how much fruit can come of it — and why the evil one will viciously attack it. And Phil has a heartwarming realization while caring for Miss Kay's health.

      <title>Ep 579 | Phil Cracks Up While Making Fun of Jase’s Word of the Day</title>
      <description>Jase shares his new vocabulary word, and Phil can't resist the urge to crack a joke that gets everyone laughing! Al discusses the tale of three mountains and Moses hiding away in the cleft of a rock as God's presence passed by. Zach talks about the way Christians do not view earthly kingdoms as enemies, but seek to win over hearts and understanding for reconciliation.

      <description>Jase, Missy, and Mia hosted dozens of families for the Mia Moo FUNDay, and the weekend even included a poolside service at the local hotel. Jase shares how families can get beyond the "Why me?" questions when they face adversity in their lives and the hardest part of helping a child — or teenager — going through what Mia has faced in her young life. Phil gripes at being kicked out of the house so Miss Kay could teach some college kids how to make chicken and dumplings. Phil and Jase have the same alarm system for unannounced visitors. Jase's frog hunt adventure led him to wonder why the first reaction to danger is to pull out a camera, rather than deal with the dangerous situation?

      <title>Ep 566 | Phil Hoodwinks Jase &amp; Willie on His Ultimate Redneck Investment </title>
      <description>Phil surprises Jase with his unusual new investment — and Jase calls Phil a "faith investor." Phil has only one phrase that comes to mind when he hears the name "Joe Biden." Jase calls for Christians to show grace to one another if they disagree, as long as they're all united on who Jesus is. Phil takes a fresh look at the Old Testament story of Naaman, and Jase applies it to a predicament he found himself in at a gas station. Phil believes storms — and definitely hurricanes — can be used to test people's faith, much like how the disciples in the boat with Jesus were tested and terrified. Plus, if these guys had been in the boat with Jesus, how would they have reacted? Al recalls fishing with Phil in the middle of a storm. Jase wants all unbelievers to read Mark 1-4. Zach cautions against the biggest threat to the kingdom of God. Jase reminds us that our anchor MUST be to Jesus and why "just believe in yourself" is terrible advice.

      <title>Ep 565 | Jase Has Another Gas Station Encounter &amp; What Will Happen in the End Times? </title>
      <description>Jase describes his most recent gas station encounter with a fan. Jase and Zach get into the usage of words like "eschatology" and "syntax." Phil says Jase's poker playing is definitely gambling. Al's injured finger gives him trouble when he's preaching. What will happen in the end times — and what does that even mean? What is the "rapture?" And will it actually happen? Jase believes it's okay for Christians to disagree about the end times — it's not a factor in salvation, so it's okay if we don't all agree about the "how."

      <title>Ep 564 | Jase Calls Out the Worst Sin of All &amp; Are Unbelievers Willfully Ignorant?</title>
      <description>Jase wishes people believed that God is the one who makes the seeds grow — not "Mother Nature" — and Phil points out that God is also the one who can prevent things from growing. Zach says people who don't believe are willfully ignorant. Jase highlights how different Jesus was than the messiah the Jews expected — they were awaiting a messiah who would conquer Rome and bring an end to wars, but Jesus ate with tax collectors, healed people, raised people from the dead, and challenged the Pharisees. Zach says our problems in the world do not need a political fix. Jase warns us all to remain open-minded and to stay away from any traditions or groups of people who don't focus on Jesus and his grace. And Phil and Jase compete over who had the lowest grades.

      <title>Ep 562 | Jase Has Multiple Birthdays Because the Internet Lies &amp; Phil Hates the Rising Crime</title>
      <description>Jase says the truth is a difficult thing to know, especially for famous people. Just take the fact that, according to the internet, he has one birthday, but it's different from his ACTUAL birthday. So every year, he has birthday messages on both days. Jase tells Al he should just cut off his injured finger — and what a great sermon illustration that would be, right?  
Phil is sure he's never seen this much crime, not just in the country, but in the world — and Jase says this is because the population is the highest it's ever been. Al says the unforgivable sin is to deny that Jesus and the Holy Spirit are one. You can't separate Jesus from good. You can't separate Satan from evil. Jase cautions against anyone calling something that is obviously sinful behavior "justified" and "good" — that's a dangerous place to be!

      <title>Ep 561 | Jep's Son Plays His First Football Game &amp; Why Jesus Had to Be Betrayed</title>
      <description>Jase talks about Jep's son getting to play his very first football game and how he could barely hold back his excitement to do the touchdown dance! Phil discusses the crowd that acknowledged Jesus' power when he performed miracles, but did not acknowledge who he was. Al discusses the requirement for Jesus to be betrayed in order for God's plan to be fulfilled. And Jase explains why he thinks it's interesting that Jesus chose to use the disciple who betrayed him instead of the other 11 who did not.

      <title>Ep 558 | Jase's Zoning Out Explained &amp; What Do We Do When God Doesn't Give Us What We Want?</title>
      <description>Jase says he's built for the outdoors, so being in a windowless room is really tough for him. And he explains why, yes, he sometimes DOES zone out during the podcast recording and why retreating to the outdoors is even biblical, following the example of Jesus. Zach says we've separated the secular from the sacred, so why is anyone wondering why the secular hasn't been transformed by the sacred? Jase points out that every human is possessed by something — whether it be sin or the Holy Spirit. Al shares about an event he attended where 46 Louisiana legislators were given awards based on the bills they brought forward that rely on biblical values. Jase explores what we do when God doesn't give us what we want.

      <title>Ep 536 | Phil Warns Against Man-eating Swamp Creature &amp; Jase Matches Politicians with Biblical Kings</title>
      <description>Jase introduces various hypothetical situations involving life or death and the human responses to them. Phil joins in with a story about the most unlikely man-eater of the swamp and how to avoid it. Al discusses desperate faith and how difficult it must have been for the Israelites to trust the plan and flee from an army toward a sea with no boats for passage! Al points out that only six of 39 biblical kings were considered good kings, and Jase says modern politicians probably have a similar percentage. And Phil tells a funny story about a puppy that survived for two months trapped inside a cave!

      <title>Ep 508 | Jase Finds a Scripture That Really Makes People Uncomfortable &amp; Phil Calls Jase a Raggedy Priest</title>
      <description>Jase explains how a high priest used to be a bridge between man and God for attempted atonement, but now we have the ultimate high priest in Jesus Christ. Phil calls Jase a raggedy-looking priest — and flawed too! Jase shares a Bible verse about Jesus that really makes a lot of people uncomfortable, and Zach makes the point that we often mistakenly — and dangerously — view God as our own cosmic bellhop.

      <description>Phil finally gets to meet his new puppies, BoBo and BeBe, and he gets to enjoy sharing them with his grandchildren. Jase addresses the problem with those who feel compelled to compare moralities as an attempt to contribute to their own salvation. Jase says the problem with performance-based salvation is that when you outperform others, it crushes them, and when you fail to perform, it crushes you. And Zach shares his favorite Phil quote of all time: "Peace of mind is the rarest commodity of all time."

      <title>Ep 502 | Phil &amp; Jep Robertson Examine the Bigness of God &amp; How Much Sin Really Weighs</title>
      <description>Jase and Phil are joined by Jep Robertson in the studio to discuss the bigness of God and to ask why Jesus really had to die. Zach discusses the movie being filmed about Phil's life and his hopes that people will look at Phil and realize that you can never be too far gone to be saved by God. Jase and Jep exult in how no sin can outweigh the infinite blood of Christ. Jase examines the problem of pouring new wine into old wineskins. Zach tells the story of a friend of his who was a heroin addict who felt he needed to get his life straight before he decided to follow Jesus Christ, in order to be worthy of the calling. Phil explains how God is the one who sanctifies us, not that we practice the process of sanctification in order to be saved.

Zach discusses the movie being filmed about Phil's life and his hopes that people will look at Phil and realize that you can never be too far gone to be saved by God. Jase and Jep exult in how no sin can outweigh the infinite blood of Christ. Jase examines the problem of pouring new wine into old wineskins. Zach tells the story of a friend of his who was a heroin addict who felt he needed to get his life straight before he decided to follow Jesus Christ, in order to be worthy of the calling. Phil explains how God is the one who sanctifies us, not that we practice the process of sanctification in order to be saved.</p><p><br></p><p>Get "Your Daily Phil: 100 Days of Truth and Freedom to Heal America's Soul" by Phil Robertson, available now: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1400235936">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1400235936</a></p><p><br></p><p>Watch the Unashamed overtime show, only on BlazeTV: <a href="https://blazetv.com/unashamed">https://BlazeTV.com/Unashamed</a></p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Ep 498 | Phil Teaches How to Know if a Spirit Is from God &amp; Why You Can Never Be Too Far Gone</title>
      <description>Phil and Al are joined by Zach Dasher to discuss discernment, and Phil reveals how to really know whether a spirit is from God or not. Al points out that because of God's omnipresence and the grace of Jesus Christ, a human can never be too far gone to be redeemed by salvation that is not earned, but freely given. Al begins a discussion on the superiority of Jesus Christ that will continue through several chapters of Hebrews. Phil points out that humans want to be under a law and a system no matter what. And Zach brings up an idea explored by T.S. Eliot: that man dreams of systems so perfect that nobody will have to be good.

      <description>Miss Kay tells Phil that his new dogs are on the way, after the recent passing of Bobo. Phil says he will name them Bobo and Bebe — Bobo wasn't the first Bobo, and he won't be the last! Jase explores the book of Hebrews with Al and Phil and how interesting it is that we are told to set our eyes on Jesus when we have believed but not yet seen. Al makes a point about blood health being used in the modern world to gauge how safe you are when it was Jesus' blood that was shed to save. And Jase's grandkids' new nickname for Jase finally sticks.

      <title>Ep 483 | Willie Robertson Steals the Show &amp; Jesus Doesn’t Live Inside Your Church Building</title>
      <description>Phil is joined in the studio by three of his sons to discuss their ministries, and Willie tells a hilarious story of when he cast a large shadow on a stage where a man was attempting to speak to an audience ... and what he did next. Al explains that Phil never would have walked into a church building had a Christian not ventured outside the church walls to find him. Willie asks what God's ambassadors are doing if we cannot interact with the world and instead hide behind the structures we confuse for the church. Phil encourages those who speak about Jesus to the world to be patient and reminds them that the power is in the message they speak and not in their own strength. And Willie tells about a girl he encouraged to speak on Jesus and share the fruit that came from her desire to know God.

      <title>Ep 482 | Phil Warns Against Counterfeit Miracles &amp; How to Remove the Curse on America</title>
      <description>Phil says the Founding Fathers probably never even considered that modern-day Americans would argue over slaughtering their own little ones. Jase talks about the lie that was told to the beginning of humanity, that we could be like God ... without God. Phil warns against the counterfeit miracles that work to conceal evil so that mankind may be deceived and confuse the good for evil and the evil for good. Al and Jase discuss the "curse" that clings to America because it is a land that allowed for the killing of innocents through the practice of abortion.

      <title>Ep 481 | Phil Drops Wisdom on Nature Conservationists &amp; Jase Guesses Why Northerners Are Grumpy</title>
      <description>Jase discusses Louisiana history, zydeco music, southern culture, and the origin of the delicious Opelousas catfish. Phil has planted thousands of bald cypress trees and aided in wetland conservation in Louisiana, but he still has a message for some of nature's biggest fans. Jase explores the interesting traits and characteristics of catfish skins correlating to their location in the river, and the guys remember Si's ultimate basketball trick shot: "The Crane." Phil talks about his 30-foot-tall willows that were planted by wild blue heron, and Jase guesses that people up North are grumpy because they don't season the food up there.

      <title>EP 480 | Phil Issues Dire Warning About American Schools &amp; Miss Kay's Beater Had a Crazy Quirk</title>
      <description>Jase realizes how difficult it is to entertain today's youth, because they have an entire world of entertainment in their cell phones and nothing seems to impress them. Phil says it is time for Americans to consider homeschooling their children, and Al takes a look at the etymology of the word "ambassador." Phil reflects on the past, from his favorite old fishing reel brands to party line telephones and the mean old women who would hog the line. And Al remembers Miss Kay's old car that had a rusted-out floor that let you watch the road pass by or, as Jase put it, "the open floor spitoon."

      <description>Jase learns about the sport of wee ball and the fun or chaos that comes with toddlers. Phil remembers his old coach, Scotty Robertson, and tells how he first got introduced to the game and where he got his first football, which replaced the ball of socks he and Si were playing with. Al laments the curse that is on America because of the millions of abortions that were allowed to take place over the past decades. Jase discusses people's tendency to associate their circumstance with God, either favorably or angrily. And Phil says people forget that the book of Revelation is a stack of seven letters written to seven churches, and he reminds us that God spits lukewarm Christians out of his mouth.

      <title>Ep 473 | Disrespecting Miss Kay, Phil's Outdated Views &amp; Why the Devil Targets American Masculinity</title>
      <description>Jase appoints Missy as the cloud in their relationship, because he relies on her for technology and her organizational skills. Al and Jase reflect on Phil's only rule growing up: "Don't you ever disrespect your mother." Phil asks why the devil would specifically target masculinity in America, and Jase recalls Phil's younger days, when his philosophy was centered on being physically tough and running barefoot through trees and rocks without showing pain. Phil called the practice, "Who's a man?" And the guys are joined by guest Jarrett Samuels, host of "The Pursuit of Manliness" podcast, to vigorously equip men for the pursuit of biblical manliness.

      <title>Ep 448 | Jase Describes Joy in Salvation &amp; Phil Explains Why Submitting to God Isn't 'All Rules'</title>
      <description>Jase describes feeling like an older brother to a group of people he was speaking to and how he was moved by the crowd's joy for their salvation. Phil explains that in order to truly change and experience the peace that comes with a repentant heart, there is a certain sobriety of mind that comes before any celebration. Jase shares a new riddle about treasure-seeking, and Phil shines light on why people have a misguided understanding about what submitting to God really is — and how it doesn't mean "all rules and no fun." And Al challenges us to find a place in scripture that requires people to forgive themselves.

      <title>Ep 442 | Jase Wrestles with the Animal Kingdom &amp; Phil Feels Strange Visiting Town</title>
      <description>Phil explains how strange it feels to go to town every four or five years when you make your home in ... the woods. Jase shares a hilarious story about the ebb and flow of the animal kingdom amid suburban living, and Al reminds us that we were sent as humans by God to rule over the Earth, including all the animals that roam it. Phil discusses unity in society and how bizarre it is to have a desire for justice against evil, yet completely disregard the possibility that the devil or even evil exist. And Jase explains how love is actually a daily choice rather than something we do when we feel like we love someone.

      <itunes:summary>Phil explains how strange it feels to go to town every four or five years when you make your home in ... the woods. Jase shares a hilarious story about the ebb and flow of the animal kingdom amid suburban living, and Al reminds us that we were sent as humans by God to rule over the Earth, including all the animals that roam it. Phil discusses unity in society and how bizarre it is to have a desire for justice against evil, yet completely disregard the possibility that the devil or even evil exist. And Jase explains how love is actually a daily choice rather than something we do when we feel like we love someone.

      <title>Ep 441 | Jase Tells How To Stop Sinful Family Cycles &amp; Phil Looks at the Relevance of God to America</title>
      <description>Jase takes a look at families and how the current generation has the ability to break family cycles of sin through the power of Jesus Christ to begin a bright and clean legacy. Al discusses the balance between order and chaos and what it has to do with real love. Phil reviews an old survey on religion in America from 1965 and compares it to a recent survey to illustrate the relevance of God in American eyes, and Jase shows how it's hard to really love people when you only see them once a week inside the walls of a church building. And Al makes a great point about how the scriptures that people choose to quarrel over are the very ones that urge believers to be united in Christ.

      <title>Ep 440 | Phil and Jase Disagree About Earth &amp; Phil Connects News of Jesus with the Gift of Tongues</title>
      <description>Phil explains why he believes the Earth is roughly 7,000 years old, while Al and Jase share a much different opinion on Earth's age. Phil makes a great point about how news of Jesus was rapidly spread across multiple regions with different languages around the same time that the Bible mentions the spiritual gift of tongues. Al discusses the theory of evolution and how it was used to strengthen his faith in the Lord. And Jase describes love and how its attributes are usually perceived by non-believers as signs of weakness, when they are actually incredibly strong and desirable characteristics.

      <title>Ep 430 | Phil Notices a Lack of Love in America &amp; Jase Reminds Us That What We Are Is Plain to God</title>
      <description>Jase reflects on one of his favorite scriptures in the book of 2 Corinthians and how man cannot be misunderstood by God. Phil has noticed that love for your fellow man has fallen far from what it once was in the past, even among some of the churches in America. Jase explains why he refuses to be paid for doing ministry work, and Al reflects on a time when he was a paid preacher himself and the effects it had on his life. Al tells about when Phil stepped in on his behalf during a difficult time, and Jase advises people to plant your seeds wherever there is an ear to listen, rather than traveling far and wide to do God's work.

      <title>Ep 429 | Phil Landed on a Cruise Ship &amp; Jase and Willie's Value Menu Adventure</title>
      <description>Al tells a funny story about one boat Phil did not want to be on, but he took the opportunity of a captive audience to preach the gospel. Jase shares a memory of a time he and Willie were boys and how they would pool their money to get the most bang for their buck out of a fast food value menu. Jase calls out churches for claiming their buildings are the "house of the Lord" and recalls a note left on a bathroom mirror from a young podcast fan named Jonathan. And Al talks about the fear of public speaking.

      <itunes:summary>Al tells a funny story about one boat Phil did not want to be on, but he took the opportunity of a captive audience to preach the gospel.

Jase calls out churches for claiming their buildings are the "house of the Lord" and recalls a note left on a bathroom mirror from a young podcast fan named Jonathan. And Al talks about the fear of public speaking.

      <description>Jase, Al, and Zach find Mark Zuckerberg and his "metaverse" creepy and disturbing, and Al suspects we'll be even more disturbed when we find out who "the android" running Facebook really is. Jase is so rude he interrupts himself — repeatedly. Phil offers up a little philosophy inspired by Chicago lyrics. Zach points out that today's disconnected, superficial culture presents a prime opportunity for the Gospel to flourish. Al dubs Jase the "world’s greatest garbage man." Phil explains why many people are called to do things for God but few are chosen. And Zach argues that technology isn't the real problem — it's the isolation of living your life virtually and worshipping created things instead of the Creator.

      <title>Ep 300 | Jase Gets a Black Eye Without Leaving the House &amp; What NOT to Do When Someone Is in Pain </title>
      <description>Jase walks through a closed door, and Missy didn't quite have the reaction he was hoping for. That leads to a discussion on marriage, people who choose not to marry, and temptation before marriage. Al admits he moved his wedding date up because biology was about to take over theology. Jase learned the hard way that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Phil doesn't believe Jase's story about a girl who came on to him in high school. The guys discuss what people miss about predestination, why Jase believes in God-orchestrated encounters, and remembering to look at things from God's perspective, not yours. Al closes with the best advice you'll ever hear about how to help people who are hurting and what kind of help they DON'T need.

      <description>Jase takes on more than a dozen bats in an epic 48-hour battle, but a tennis racket, Google, a phone call to Missy, and a sheet are no match for the creepy invaders squatting in his house.

      <description>Phil learns that a Facebook commenter "strongly dislikes" him, and he's thoroughly amused. It's mayhaw season, and Phil is feeling his age after picking fruit. Jase is feeling it too after taking on his archnemesis — a fly. Phil is not about to let a furry little trespasser stand between him and some mayhaw jelly. The guys discuss trees and fruit in the Bible, free will, why God allowed evil into the world, poisonous plants, and the intelligent design of trees. Jase chuckles at weather people who mispronounce the names of parishes. And Phil asks the audience for advice on transplanting his mayhaw trees.

      <title>Ep 264 | When Phil Met Steven Tyler, Willie's Diet Competition, and Churches and Gender Pronouns</title>
      <description>Phil rocks out to Alice Cooper, and he and Al remember the time Aerosmith's Steven Tyler approached them in a hotel lobby. Jase has another close encounter of the convenience store kind when someone yells at him to put a mask on. He also has a run-in with a couple of guys who don't take kindly to his kind at the golf course. Al and Jase tell the story of how competitive (and MEAN) Willie got when he made a weight-loss bet. Phil reveals what helped his faith more than anything, and it never would have happened without "Duck Dynasty." Al talks about engaging on gender pronouns and other cultural issues when even churches try to muzzle us. And the guys discuss spiritual decapitation, whether or not it's biblical for women to be ambassadors of the church, and stuffy church rules that burn bridges instead of bringing people closer to Jesus.

        <![CDATA[<p>Phil rocks out to Alice Cooper, and he and Al remember the time Aerosmith's Steven Tyler approached them in a hotel lobby. Jase has another close encounter of the convenience store kind when someone yells at him to put a mask on. He also has a run-in with a couple of guys who don't take kindly to his kind at the golf course. Al and Jase tell the story of how competitive (and MEAN) Willie got when he made a weight-loss bet. Phil reveals what helped his faith more than anything, and it never would have happened without "Duck Dynasty." Al talks about engaging on gender pronouns and other cultural issues when even churches try to muzzle us.

      <title>Ep 259 | Jase's Circumcision Question, It's Hard to Love Judgmental People, and an R-Rated Verse</title>
      <description>Mia is headed back to school less than a month after major surgery. Phil, Jase, and Al love how unifying it was to hold the Masters in Georgia amid all the controversy and boycotts — even if Phil does find golf stressful and embarrassing. In another chapter of "Jase's Grocery Store Chronicles," someone grills Jase about how Jesus could be a plan. Jase has been in plenty of men's rooms, and there's something in the Bible he just can't figure out about circumcision. And the guys talk about why it's much harder to show grace to people who are legalistic, the R-rated verse you don't hear in many sermons, and how changed lives become evidence of God's grace.

      <title>Ep 255 | Phil Uses a Fake Name, Baptizes a Preacher, and Makes Off with Jase's King Cake</title>
      <description>Phil gives a fake name to two women who got lost and ended up at his church building on Easter, and Jase can't quite figure out why. Phil just seems to attract unusual people to his unusual church plant, including a preacher who wants to be baptized. The guys get into what the Bible says about dressing up for church services, the kickoff of crawfish season, and weird preacher fashion trends. And Jase eats the greatest king cake he's ever had, but it disappears. It looks like Phil is the culprit, but that's not the only mystery surrounding this dessert.

      <title>Ep 248 | Phil's Alternative to Overthrowing the Government, Al's New Movie &amp; Jase's Space Invaders</title>
      <description>Al discovers one of his scenes was cut from the new film "Roe v. Wade." Jase has been plagued by space invaders since he was a kid. Phil points to a passage in the Bible that holds the solution to all racism. Jase was once welcomed to a new school with a slap across the face from a guy who ended up becoming his neighbor. And the guys discuss where teenage hostility comes from, why overthrowing the government isn't the answer, the movement to resegregate society, why God is greater than any calendar, and the horrifying reality that people are still killed for their Christian faith.

      <title>Ep 247 | An Update on Mia Robertson's Extensive Surgery and the Difficult Recovery Ahead</title>
      <description>Jase is back with an update on how his daughter, Mia, is doing after her longest, most extensive craniofacial surgery yet. He describes many of the challenges ahead, including swelling that will last 12 months. Phil marvels that he's never heard a word of complaint from Mia. Jase is nearly defeated by NASCAR-like driving conditions in Dallas and has to play the "I have a gun" card at his hotel, but an encounter with a young couple at the hospital fills him with encouragement. And Phil opens it up with a story about netting a big (and nasty) surprise. Thanks for your prayers and support!

      <description>Phil, Al, and One Kingdom's Mike Kellett talk favoritism, why the self-segregation spreading on college campuses and beyond is so unbiblical, and why violence always follows prejudice. Phil is always prepared — even at the doctor's office. The guys look back on a year of lockdowns and discuss the church as a living organism, the pruning happening in churches, and the problem of "unconverted believers" in the church. And Phil offers a reminder that God doesn't live in church buildings.

      <title>Ep 242 | Miss Kay's Hospitality, Tossing Out Food Laws, and How to Stop Fueling Cancel Culture</title>
      <description>Miss Kay takes the practice of hospitality to a whole new level. Phil and Jase are glad we're no longer bound by the old food laws, especially when shrimp is on the menu. The guys tackle the great fallacy of cancel culture, how cancel culture is really the opposite of what God does, and how we can stop providing this ungodly phenomenon the fuel it needs. They also discuss God and favoritism, the difference between being baptized by the Holy Spirit and being baptized in water, and the greatest weapon the world has ever known.

      <title>Ep 235 | Jase's Miserable Trip, What 'Have a Nice Day' Really Means, and Why There Are No Rules</title>
      <description>Jase the Land Looter heads to Virginia for some metal detecting and finds something he's never seen before. He follows that up with a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day, including hours on a runway, tempers flaring, an unhinged coronavirus rant, awful manners, multiple companies refusing to rent him a car, and a guy who thinks Jase is down on his luck after "Duck Dynasty." Phil looks for the pulse of America and isn't thrilled with what he finds. And the guys tackle audience questions about what it really means that there are no rules and how to break free from legalism.

The guys talk about comedy in the face of the cancel mob, how Adam's "No Safe Spaces" documentary foreshadowed the current cancel culture, and why a statue of any of them would be torn down. Adam's latest book is "I'm Your Emotional Support Animal: Navigating Our All Woke, No Joke Culture."

      <title>Ep 224 | Phil Robertson's Answer to Cancel Culture and the People in Power Who Want to Silence You</title>
      <description>Phil and Al share the best response to people in power who want to censor, silence, and punish you. They offer a blueprint for standing up for what's right in a culture where conservative Christians are canceled for their beliefs. But first, Phil gives his Super Bowl review, and it's not pretty. He also talks about the sermon he preached on hope. Al and Phil get a good chuckle out of Acts 5, and Al points out how much Phil's "Duck Dynasty" experience mirrors that text.

      <title>Ep 219 | Jase's Spiritual Stocks, the Bible on Investing and Tattoos, and Lying to the Holy Spirit</title>
      <description>Jase says more power to the retail investors who went up against hedge funds shorting GameStop, but he's sticking with long-term investments. Phil, Jase, and Al look at what the Bible says about investing and acquiring wealth, and Jase finds a parable in Luke that makes for a good stock market analogy. The guys also discuss what the Bible tells Christians about tattoos, why you don't want to mess around with the Holy Spirit, hypocrisy in those who represent heaven, the stock market in your heart, and whether you can make the argument that scaring the hell out of people is biblical.

      <title>Ep 217 | Phil Checks Out Fireball Videos, Why There Are Atheists, and Do You Need to Be Rebaptized?</title>
      <description>Phil doesn't remember ever running out of gas, but Jase sure does, and it reminds him of how he used to siphon gas for Phil. Al recalls the last time he burned an egg carton. And speaking of burning things, for a guy who doesn't own a cellphone, Phil knows a lot about viral explosion videos. Jase is not a fan of churches that will only baptize you if you "join." The guys also talk about the world's sorriest gas cans, and they answer two audience questions: Why did God put atheists on the Earth, and do you need to be baptized again if you fall away from your walk with God?

      <title>Ep 216 | The Phil Robertson Message They Want to Cancel, Jase's Crowd &amp; This Thing Can't Be Stopped</title>
      <description>Phil, Jase, and Al have a whole lot to say about persecuting believers, those who look down on Christians, and the spirit of boldness that emerges when the culture tries to shut you down and shut you up. Al says they're coming for us, and they want to redefine misinformation and stop "this thing" from spreading. Would Martin Luther King Jr.'s message be tolerated in today's culture? Jase finds a blueprint in Acts 4 for how to respond to persecution, and he shares a recent deli encounter that drew an unexpected crowd.

      <title>Ep 210 | Jase's Paper Towel Problem, Phil's Church Sign Idea, and Censors Can't Stop the Gospel</title>
      <description>Phil unveils his theory on why we still can't get enough toilet paper and paper towels. Jase finally finds his favorite brand of paper towels, but there's a twist he didn't see coming. The guys dive into Acts 2 and how the disciples were given the ability to be heard in all languages. Jase offers his response to "What would Jesus do?" Phil makes a pitch for what to put on church signs. And Zach and Jase discuss the dangers of making a name for yourself. God often uses the last person you'd expect, in a way you'd never choose. But if people speaking different languages can't stop the spread of the Gospel, censorship can't stop it either.

      <title>Ep 209 | Phil Robertson's '15-Year Jail Sentence,' Social Media Lies, and Why Judas Sold Out Jesus</title>
      <description>Phil still isn't a CBD oil exec, but is he serving 15 years in prison? Facebook hasn't fact-checked it yet, so it must be true. Jase has a theory about why the scam artists picked Phil's face for the CBD hoax. Phil considers the influence of the Father of Lies, Al talks about the Parler shutdown and where we're headed, and Zach points out the kingdom work being done online. Jase has been censored for "sensitive" content before, but he's pumped about his Jesus ground game. And the guys discuss the Holy Spirit as the ultimate ace card, why Judas betrayed Jesus, and why seeing miracles isn't enough to save someone.

      <title>Ep 195 | When Phil Kicked Miss Kay Out, How Lisa Told Al the Truth, Double Lives, and Desperation | Ep 195</title>
      <description>Miss Kay and Lisa Robertson sit down in the Unashamed Lair with Phil and Al. After roasting Jase in his absence, the ladies open up about what it's really like to be a Robertson woman. Miss Kay reveals what attracted her to Phil, what she had against nice boys, how their first date went, and why Phil dumped her when they were teenagers. Lisa explains how she and Al got together, what their relationship was like when she just thought she was a Christian, and how she told Al the truth about her affair. This sets the stage for a candid discussion of the ways we justify sin, living a double life, and the desperate moments that lead to healing when we cry out for God.

      <title>Ep 182 | Phil Rips Thanksgiving Lockdowns, Biden's 'Unity' &amp; Morrissey vs. the Duckmen</title>
      <description>Jase finds the authoritarian Thanksgiving restrictions in California and Oregon absurd, and Phil has a pretty good idea where the rules are coming from and where they're headed. Al is sick of the mask hypocrisy from the "orange man bad" crowd. The guys are fed up with coronavirus restrictions being used to go after believers, and they're not expecting Joe Biden to keep any of his "kumbaya" promises. But first, Phil, Jase, and Al are unashamed to hunt and eat game despite Morrissey's refusal to do a TV appearance with them. The guys drool over Phil's hamburger recipe, but Jase has one good reason he likes vegetarians. And with duck season about to start, Phil and Jase have never seen this many ducks.

      <description>Phil and Jase talk about creative (and delicious!) ways to cook deer, why eating game is biblical, and why young deer are way better than big bucks. Phil likes to eat wild game, but mounting it on the wall isn't really his thing. Jase explains the concept of email to Phil. The guys respond to a question that comes up when we go public about the Gospel: "Who do you think you are?" And Phil laments that in today's culture, the "truth" doesn't include Jesus.

      <title>Ep 165 | The Benham Brothers &amp; Fake News, Silent Christian Celebs &amp; Social Justice in the Church</title>
      <description>David and Jason Benham were the targets of fake news and cancel culture before those things were trendy hashtags. On their "Unashamed" debut, the Benham brothers talk with Phil and Al about how to live boldly for Jesus, how to demolish anything that goes up against the knowledge of God, and how they built their real estate company on scripture. David and Jason look back at GLAAD's cancel campaign against them and discuss the agenda to silence, marginalize, demonize, and criminalize Christians. The guys also tackle the silence of many Christian celebrities and how failing to speak up hinders the gospel. And Al describes an event with 30+ pastors where he heard more about social justice than the gospel.

      <title>Ep 123 | Jase Attempts a Bathroom MacGyver, Spitting in the South &amp; Why Bad Things Happen (Part 2) </title>
      <description>Phil, Jase, and Al discuss the many reasons why bad things happen to good people and how Jesus heals. This requires an unexpected detour into spitting as a southern cultural phenomenon, spitting in baseball, and spitting in the Bible. The guys also discuss the tree of life, sin, and restoration. But first, Jase tries to MacGyver the drain in his bubbling, gurgling bathroom, and his hairball fishing expedition doesn't quite cut it.

      <description>Phil, Jase, and Al tackle amateur theologian Don Lemon's ignorance about Jesus and begin a discussion of why God allows bad things to happen to people. But first, Jase talks about the death of Missy's grandmother and why believers can find solace when a loved one dies. Al and Phil talk about Phyllis' inspiring blog. Jase has a bone to pick with how some people interpret the end of "The Outlaw Josey Wales," and he expresses his annoyance with mask manufacturers. And Phil is devastated by one of Thomas Jefferson's failures.

      <title>Ep 121 | Phil Proves Self-Defense Is Biblical, Jase's Scary Supper, and Animal Control Visits Willie</title>
      <description>Phil, Jase, and Al explain why Jesus wasn't a pacifist and lay down biblical defenses of the right to protect yourself and others. But first, it might be time for Phil to patent his tried-and-true technique for amplifying his hearing. Jase strikes fear in his teenage houseguests with his "terrifying" supper and gives Missy a scare when he discovers a critter on his property. And animal control pays a visit to Willie's place after an unusual deer incident.

      <itunes:summary>Phil, Jase, and Al explain why Jesus wasn't a pacifist and lay down biblical defenses of the right to protect yourself and others. But first, it might be time for Phil to patent his tried-and-true technique for amplifying his hearing. Jase strikes fear in his teenage houseguests with his "terrifying" supper and gives Missy a scare when he discovers a critter on his property. And animal control pays a visit to Willie's place after an unusual deer incident.

      <title>Ep 120 | The Two Things Phil Robertson Won't Do, Calamity Jase, and Trying to Find a Church</title>
      <description>Phil has two things he definitely won't do, and he thinks it's about time for Jase to follow suit. Jase's first frog hunt of the season is full of calamities, and he plays a really bad game of golf. Phil encounters a heckler who accuses him of white supremacy. Al and Phil have a strong dislike of church pews. And the guys talk about what a redneck really is, choosing a church, picking a denomination, and why the whole idea of trying to find a church doesn't make much sense.

      <description>Phil is shocked by the price of a trip to the barbershop. After Willie's dramatic haircut, Jase gives himself a trim and shares his DIY technique.

      <title>Ep 97 | Phil Robertson's Answer to Police Brutality and Mob Violence</title>
      <description>Phil, Jase, and Al discuss the Minneapolis police officer's appalling disregard for George Floyd's life, Americans' response, and the eruption of violence, looting, and arson. The fix isn't political — it's spiritual. The guys also talk about their recent family vacation and why Phil didn't join the getaway. And after a case of mistaken identity, Jase decides it's time to get rid of some of the gray in his beard.

      <title>Ep 89 | Phil's Living Room Plague, BIG'N's Halo, and Did Judas Have a Choice?</title>
      <description>Phil fights a plague in his living room and fire ants in his pants, BIG'N is driven close to insanity, and Missy runs the nets with Jase — voluntarily! Phil surveys the damage after a tornado turns his duck blind upside down. And the guys answer a question about Judas' betrayal: Did God create us and not give us a choice between right and wrong? Bonus: Jase reveals the inspiration for this frequently shared "Duck Dynasty" quote: "When you don't know what you're doing, it's best to do it quickly."

      <title>Ep 75 | Jase's Easter Rule, Heaven and Hell, Drinking Battery Acid, and the Love of Jesus </title>
      <description>Happy Easter! Phil and Jase have very strong feelings about what they won't wear on Easter. Phil wants ladies to thank God they don't have a prostate, and Jase refuses to drink battery acid with a pastor. And we're answering your questions about heaven, hell, and the resurrection: Why didn't Jesus have to go to hell to pay for our sins? Do Christians have to believe in heaven and hell? What about reincarnation?

      <title>Ep 66 | Coronavirus PANIC: Fear of the Unknown, Fear of God, and Fear of the Zombie Apocalypse</title>
      <description>Phil, Jase, and Al wonder if the media is overstating the coronavirus panic. That leads to a discussion about fear of the virus, fear of the unknown, fear of God, and of course, fear of the zombie apocalypse. The Robertsons also explain the key to being free of anxiety when everyone else is falling apart and ponder why some people's minds go blank when they try to picture God.
