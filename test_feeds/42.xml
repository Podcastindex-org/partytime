			<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s easy for the church to look self-righteously at the culture and point a lot of fingers at all “they” are doing wrong while we go sit quietly in our pews and make sure we don’t talk about politics in the pulpit. But when we look at the failing culture, we can usually trace the cultural issue back to a previous incorrect (or lack of) application of doctrine in the church.</p><p>Don’t miss this energetic conversation where Brian and Heidi are making a direct connection between the Bible, our system of government, and how we need to approach this today. You’ll leave this conversation encouraged not just to“hang in there,” but to move forward with hope and direction. </p><p>Show Notes: <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/god-able-conversation-brian-noble" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/god-able-conversation-brian-noble</a></p><p> </p><p>Watch the Heidi St. John Podcast on Youtube</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HeidiStJohnPodcast" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">youtube.com/@HeidiStJohnPodcast</a></p><p>Watch the Heidi St. John Podcast on Rumble</p><p><a href="https://rumble.com/user/HeidiStJohn" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">https://rumble.com/user/HeidiStJohn</a></p><p>Find Heidi on Instagram</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/heidistjohn/" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">instagram.com/heidistjohn/</a></p><p>Find Heidi on Facebook</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/realheidistjohn" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">facebook.com/realheidistjohn</a></p><p>Find Heidi on X</p><p><a href="https://x.com/heidistjohn" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">x.com/heidistjohn</a></p><p>Join Heidi at Faith That Speaks</p><p><a href="https://faiththatspeaks.com/" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">faiththatspeaks.com/</a></p><p>Submit your questions for Mailbox Monday</p><p><a href="https://www.heidistjohn.net/mailboxmonday" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">heidistjohn.net/mailboxmonday</a></p>

			<title><![CDATA[A Grown Up Message to the Church with Bill Federer]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Our country is in a decision making moment, and we can’t afford to get it wrong.

What is the basic role of government and how does that provide clarity now? Why can’t we just sit on the sidelines? Be prepared with a pen and a notebook-you’re going to want to take notes!</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Our country is in a decision making moment, and we can’t afford to get it wrong. Bill Federer is a wealth of historical knowledge and is recounting many stories of times in the past that we can learn from. What is the basic role of government and how does that provide clarity now? Why can’t we just sit on the sidelines? Be prepared with a pen and a notebook-you’re going to want to take notes!&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Homeschooling is being judged, and the results are in: it’s a smashing success.

Zan is sharing her most valuable results of homeschooling, the successes reported by college staff, and what she’d do differently if she had the chance to do it again.</p>

&lt;p&gt;There is so much happening right now! Exciting things are happening in the pro-life department as we see President Trump and Vice President Vance standing for life in several ways. Pence and others are pushing against RFK’s senate approval, Washington state has several bills that require strong, immediate, resistance from Washington citizens, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Sibling Relationships and the Adolescent Brain with Sherri Seligson]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>
</p>
<p>Every parent of multiple children understands the challenges that come with sibling relationships, and we’re here today to encourage and guide you on how to foster those relationships. Then as our kids move into the tween and teen years, their brains change and with that, their emotional needs change too. My good friend Sherri Seligson, mother of four, veteran homeschool mom, and author is with me today sharing practical tips and wisdom she learned through her parenting years. </p>
<p>In a bonus segment, we have Tricia Goyer joining us as she and Sherri talk about their delightful new book “Wondersof the Ocean Realm” and the importance of faith as we explore science.</p>

<p>Of all the social struggles we are experiencing in the world today, perhaps none has done more damage than the insidious lie that a person’s biological sex can be altered through hormones and surgery. My guest today can speak to the tragedy of this social contagion with authority and compassion—because he was a victim of this ideology himself. Walt Heyer joins me to shine a bright light into the dark world of “transgenderism” and share his powerful story of redemption and recovery from childhood grooming and trauma. Walt courageously shares his heartache and the regret he lives with because he underwent sex “reassignment” surgery and lived as a woman for 8 years. We’ll talk about why we must stop using language that normalizes scenarios that aren’t even physically possible. This is a powerful interview that you will want to share—because it’s a story of the hope and healing that’s available in Christ.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>

<p>How do you know if a habit has become an addiction? And what do you do if it has? What causes us to become addicted? There are a lot of questions about this issue, and my friend Dr. Tim Clinton from the American Association of Christian Counselors is here to help us with the answers and offer resources if you’re looking for a place to go.

			<title><![CDATA[Mailbox Monday | Affirmation Culture, Parenting Regret and More]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>
</p>
<p>You guys ask the best questions! How can we encourage pastors? Should Christians be using “affirmations”? Should we celebrate my non-Christian friends adopting a baby?</p>
<p>A mom is asking if it’s ok to take a break from church for a chronically ill son, another mom is grieving her years of not serving the Lord as her son is now uninterested in following Christ and is living with his girlfriend, and a woman is struggling to be intimate with her husband while she has some physical issues. Listen in friends, I think you’ll be encouraged!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Cultivating Courage in Your Children with Kathy Koch]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Courage is lacking in our culture today as we see in the church and conservative politicians on a daily basis. My good friend Kathy Koch is joining me to discuss the critical role of courage in today's culture, especially in the context of parenting and raising resilient children. We’re defining courage and highlighting practical strategies for teaching courage to children, including the significance of parental examples and specific affirmations. It is critical to demonstrate intentional listening, courage, faith, and worship in parenting so our kids see it modeled in real life. The example we set will have a generational impact!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[From Planned Parenthood Director to Pro-Life Leader with Abby Johnson]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Abby Johnson has always been fiercely determined to help women in need. This desire is what led Abby to a career with Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider, and caused her to flee the organization, becoming an outspoken advocate for the pro-life movement. I met Abby this summer at a pro-life event where we were speaking together in Washington, D.C., and this lady is the real deal. She's joining me today to talk about the future of the pro-life movement in a post-Biden era and share her story of exiting her established career at Planned Parenthood.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Tracy and Bernard Tourneur are fighting for freedom to homeschool in France. Having been ordered by the French government to register their son in school, they refused to comply. As a consequence, they’ve been indicted, interrogated and ultimately fled France to return home to the United States with a newfound love and respect for freedom and the constitution of America.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[When Christians Vote, We WIN with Dr. George Barna]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>As many as 104 million people of faith, including 32 million self-identified Christians who regularly attend church, are unlikely to vote in the upcoming 2024 presidential election on Nov. 5 mainly due to lack of interest, research from the Cultural Research Center at Arizona Christian University shows. </p>
<p>Today, the author of this new study, Dr. George Barna joins me to discuss why he believes that “the 32 million Christians sitting in the pews each week who refuse to vote are a game changer. It's low hanging fruit for pastors as they try to motivate those congregants to carry out their civic duty and honor God through their influence for things that matter in our culture."</p>

			<title><![CDATA[It’s Not *just* Political… It’s Biblical with Pastor Phil Hopper]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Every society needs a higher moral authority, or it falls into moral anarchy. Moral destruction leads to the collapse of civilization. Without the internal morality that comes from a higher authority, humans abuse their personal liberty, turning it into self-idolatry leading to the collapse of society (Romans 1:21-28). When a society embraces moral anarchy, God judges that culture by allowing collapse from within or calamity from without. Pastor Phil returns to the podcast today to talk about current events and how Christians should respond to the issues we’re facing.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Washington State has not had a Republican governor for over forty years. FORTY YEARS! Today, I’m joined by the man who I believe could end the string of bad leaders in our state. Dave Reichert is running to bring hope and common sense back to Washington State, and the stakes have never been higher. Listen in as we go beyond the rhetoric to the real issues we’re facing here and around the nation. We’ve been struggling for a long time with high taxes, bad legislation and over-regulation in Washington, but it doesn’t have to be this way.  Together, we can change what’s wrong, fix what’s broken and do what’s right for Washington. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today I’m honored to be joined by Congressional candidate, Joe Kent. You may remember that we ran for the same seat in 2022— and we have teamed up to help bring Republicans together in this crucial election season. The reason is simple: when Republicans work together—we win. Whether it’s here in Washington State or around the country, it’s time for all of us to form a united front so that we can advance freedom and work toward the restoration of our nation. If you’re ready for a return to common sense policies, limited government and lower inflation, and energy independence, listen in and be encouraged. Let’s vote with one united voice this November!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[How Freedom is Supposed to Work with Judge Dave Larson]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Judge Dave Larson is joining me here today to discuss the critical role of the judiciary in democracy, the importance of educating the public about judicial races, and the ethical boundaries judges must navigate. He emphasizes the need for judges to apply the law as written, rather than legislating from the bench, and highlights the challenges of judicial selection and campaign finance. We’re also touching on the need for reform in the judicial election process in order to enhance public awareness and trust in the judiciary. In this conversation, Judge Larson highlights the role of education in fostering civic responsibility and the necessity of active participation in democracy to combat tyranny and ensure freedom.</p>
<p>This conversation is straight fire! You won’t want to miss it. </p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;In recent months, we have seen increased online attacks targeting wonderful parents. My guests today have unfortunately been given a front row seat in the battle for parental rights. JD and Britney Lott are social media influencers who have been raising their eight children on the road and they are joining me today to share a cautionary tale about what can happen when CPS is weaponized to target innocent parents.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We are hearing more and more about young kids grappling with same-sex attraction. It&#39;s prevalent in the culture right now. Many kids today, many of them coming out of the government school system, see absolutely nothing wrong with transgenderism or same-sex attraction. And it&#39;s becoming an increasingly challenging subject for parents to navigate, given the fact that there are a lot of grownups in the room who are telling parents to affirm their child’s every whim. Are you prepared to handle these conversations as they come up? Join me today for a practical conversation about this difficult topic. </p>

			<title><![CDATA[What’s a Pro-Lifer To Do With Trump? With Pastor Rob McCoy]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Like many of you, I am very concerned with what&#39;s happening in the government right now, particularly as it relates to social and moral issues. Chief among them is the issue of abortion. The question in the church right now is whether or not evangelicals and Bible-believing Christians should vote for a candidate that does not have a 100% solid pro-life stance. We’ve seen some major voices in the pro-life movement refuse to vote for Trump. Pastor Rob McCoy joins me on the show today to discuss this very important issue and how we as evangelicals should frame the discussion of life in this next election. </p>

			<title><![CDATA[Freedom to Homeschool: Don’t Take it for Granted with Attorney James Mason]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>A handful of states still retain antiquated laws from the 1980s and 90s, but most states have removed unnecessary legal barriers with the recognition that homeschooling works. But pendulums swing, and in America today, the pendulum frequently swings in the wrong direction. Opponents of homeschool freedom are working in new and more coordinated ways to make homeschooling harder and less accessible to parents. </p>
<p>Legislative action to roll back homeschool freedom is being considered in three states in part because of negative portrayals of homeschooling in the press. My guest today is Attorney James (Jim) Mason. He is the president of the Homeschool Legal Defense Association. We&#39;re going to cover the history of homeschooling and the role that the Homeschool Legal Defense Association has been playing for over 40 years in securing and maintaining homeschool freedom. And as always, what you can do to help secure your freedom to homeschool in America in the coming years. </p>

Opponents of homeschool freedom are working in new and more coordinated ways to make homeschooling harder and less accessible to parents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legislative action to roll back homeschool freedom is being considered in three states in part because of negative portrayals of homeschooling in the press. My guest today is Attorney James (Jim) Mason. He is the president of the Homeschool Legal Defense Association. We&amp;#39;re going to cover the history of homeschooling and the role that the Homeschool Legal Defense Association has been playing for over 40 years in securing and maintaining homeschool freedom. And as always, what you can do to help secure your freedom to homeschool in America in the coming years. &lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[1916: The How and Why of Our Progressive Culture Shift with Seth Gruber]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In August of 2019, the New York Times inaugurated the 1619 Project. Their goal was to offer a new origin story of the American Republic. They argued that 1776 is not the origin of America as we know it, but rather, 1619, the year the first slaves were brought to American shores, as our true origin. They, of course, sought to link every supposed evil and ill of the 21st century with the racist heritage of 1619, America&#39;s “real” birthday. </p>
<p>If you want to understand what ideas and individuals brought us third trimester abortions, infanticide, euthanasia, pornographic quote, sex ed, critical race theory, transgenderism, transitioning of children, drag queen story hours and arresting pro-life sidewalk counselors, you&#39;ve got to go back not to 1619, but to 1916, a year that my guest today says represents nothing less than civilization&#39;s pivot point. Seth Gruber is the founder of the White Rose Resistance and he&#39;s here today to talk about his new book and film, 1916. You guys buckle up. This was a fantastic conversation. You&#39;re gonna be encouraged.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: This may be a difficult conversation for children, so I recommend listening ahead of time. </strong></p>

			<title><![CDATA[Social Media: There is a Better Way With Benjamin Laws]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>You are likely aware of the devastating impact that social media has had on Gen X and on the millennials in the last two decades. We are watching a rise in depression and anxiety, kids who are addicted to social media, others who have committed suicide over things that have happened to them on social media, and dwindling interpersonal relationship skills. And the question becomes, is there an alternative to what we see on Facebook and Instagram and TikTok and so many of these other platforms? </p>
<p>It’s a good moment to take a collective pause as parents to look for a better way. Ben Laws is here from TUVU to join this conversation about the importance of engaging with your kids, the dangers of social media, and why I really think that we can do a better job of helping our kids be connected to those around them without the devastating negative effects.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Homeschooling is growing as parents are taking control of their children’s education. Alex Newman joins me today to discuss the importance of homeschooling in light of the dangers of government-controlled education.

It is imperative that we get as many kids as possible out of the current system, and we’re here to help you do that. </p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Homeschooling is growing as parents are taking control of their children’s education. Alex Newman joins me today to discuss the importance of homeschooling in light of the dangers of government-controlled education. We’re covering the history of public schools and the ideological agenda behind them. It is imperative that we get as many kids as possible out of the current system, and we’re here to help you do that. &lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>What would you do if the Bible in its current form became illegal? The multi-talented actor Brett Varvel is joining me on the show today to explore this important question and the requirement of absolute truth in a culture that is prone to idol worship. He&#39;s got a brand new movie out called Disciples in the Moonlight which explores a version of America where the Bible has been outlawed and Christians are faced with the choice of going along with the status quo or remaining firm in their faith. This discussion is a reminder to Christians to use their talents and platforms for the glory of God and to boldly live out their faith. </p>

			<title><![CDATA[Value Nothing More Than Truth with Rod Dreher]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>As we head into the heart of election season these last few months, we are seeing how high the stakes are, and the Biden administration is scrambling as they try to lessen the blow of Biden’s debate performance and recent cognitive challenges, the press secretary even accusing conservatives of creating fake videos in order to make Biden’s situation look worse than it actually is. We also see boys trying to be girls and doctors telling us men can have babies.

			<title><![CDATA[Sex, Lies, and Childhood: Inoculate Your Kids Against the Lies of Woke Culture]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Listen in on a live workshop where Heidi shares with homeschool parents at a recent homeschool conference.</p>
<p>God’s Word teaches us that the primary job of parents is to raise children who are equipped, both spiritually and mentally for the “real world.” Our assignment? To prepare our kids to stand against “the schemes of the devil.” Trouble is—the language of woke culture often gets right by busy parents. Who has time to learn all the new words and phrases that seem to be created every other week? If you’re struggling to keep up, join Heidi St. John as she equips you to easily identify the language of the left and teach your own children to do the same.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Making Boys into Men in Trail Life USA with Mark Hancock]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>News broke recently that the Boy Scouts of America is changing its name to Scouting America on the organization&#39;s 115th anniversary. According to the Associated Press, the Boy Scouts will become Scouting America in an effort to emphasize inclusion as it works to move past the turmoil of bankruptcy and a flood of sexual abuse claims. Scouts&#39; lack of acknowledgement of the crisis among boys in our culture is only a small part of the problem.</p>
<p>I’m joined today by Mark Hancock, the CEO of Trail Life USA which is an answer to the deep crisis affecting boys in America. It’s the largest Christ-centered, boy-focused scout-type organization in the country. Trail Life USA has 1,100 Troops and more than 50,000 members in all 50 states. These guys are doing an incredible job helping young boys become godly men. </p>

			<title><![CDATA[Studying Fine Arts From a Biblical Perspective With Sandy Yang]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>It seems as if the left has stolen the arts, but just like the rainbow, the arts were God’s idea. But why do fine arts matter to Christians, why is it critical for our children to study them, and most importantly–why are they a valuable alternative to pop culture entertainment? Sandy Yang is here from Cedarville University to share what art really is and how important it is to study it from a Biblical perspective. I loved this discussion, and I know you will, too!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Conservatives Targeted for Exercising Free Speech with Joeylynn Mesaros]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Five years ago, a whole lot of the country sleepily went throughout their average days <em>and </em>election days without having any clue how much it really mattered who was in our local or state offices. I’d venture to say many didn’t even see how much damage one president could do in just four years’ time. But it’s awfully clear now! Parents at school board meetings called domestic terrorists, a presumptive republican presidential candidate prosecuted and convicted for years old crimes that had no detrimental effect on literally anyone, and ordinary citizens jailed for praying outside of abortion clinics and charged with KKK crimes for exercising free speech. We can not keep sitting it out and hoping for the best! Don’t live in fear, but use your voice to inform yourself and those in your circle. We have to get off the bench! </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Biden administration officially abolished Title IX as we knew it because they have decreed that sex is the same thing as gender. (We all know that gender is a made-up term the left is using to hijack women&#39;s spaces and women&#39;s sports.)</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the way the Biden administration has rewritten Title IX is going to be damaging to women on just about every front, and my guest today has a lot to say about it. Dallas Malloy is a 2023 International Women&#39;s Boxing Hall of Fame inductee, and she is speaking loudly to issues of sex and gender as it relates to women who are really fighting for their lives in women&#39;s sports right now and why it&#39;s so important that we speak up against it. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s no surprise kids are struggling with identity these days, but we can’t let it stay this way.

			<title><![CDATA[Cancel Culture and the Church with Sam Sanden]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>My good friend Pastor Sam Sanden is here with me today and we are talking about cancel culture within the church and the effect it has on individuals and ministries, while underscoring the crucial role of grace, forgiveness, and restoration. We’re also discussing the significance of actively participating in culture and leveraging our influence for the glory of God, and we can not miss the opportunity to pray for our leaders and support their ministries.</p>
<p>If you stick around for Happy Hour, Sam and I are talking about challenges associated with ministry and Sam passionately shares his commitment to being a beacon of salt and light in the public sphere, urging fellow Christians to exercise their right to vote and even consider running for office. We’re also sharing resources available to churches navigating political involvement.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;My good friend Pastor Phil Hopper is here today to answer your questions. We’re talking about the revival of Christianity among the younger generation and the rise of young Christians, whether women can be pastors, and the biblical perspective on deliverance ministry and casting out demons. And we won’t miss the opportunity to discuss the #hegetsus campaign from the Superbowl this weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stick around for the extended podcast where we’ll talk during Happy Hour about the false doctrines surrounding hell and Christian universalism. We’ll end on the importance of finding a good church and the significance of studying and applying the Word of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t miss it! &lt;/p&gt;

We&#39;re going to answer listener questions about weaning off SSRIs, eating healthy on a limited budget, the benefits of NAD+ IV therapy and hydrogen water, losing weight through walking, overcoming alcohol addiction, the benefits of iodine in the healthy salt trend, the benefits of infrared saunas, and body image concerns after pregnancy and breastfeeding. </p>
<p>Join us as a subscriber for Happy Hour where an anonymous listener asked about Mark&#39;s thoughts on breast implants and whether or not it was safe. She said she&#39;s really struggling. She&#39;s a mother of several children. She&#39;s been a breastfeeding mom and her self-confidence is at an all time low. So we&#39;re gonna talk about that. She said, “Dr. Mark, could you help a girl out with advice and words of encouragement on how to embrace the way my body looks now?” You won’t want to miss this conversation.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that from the very beginning, our public school system has been trying to remove God from the schools and instill collectivism while separating kids from their parents? It&#39;s true, and we&#39;re losing our kids to it. For the next couple of episodes, I&#39;m going to talk about this battle for the heart, which is education in the 21st century. I’ll go into the history of the American Education System, and today I’ll be starting with its founders. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Join me today to talk about fasting and its relevance for Christians today. I’ll be teaching from the story of Esther and highlighting the importance of living a set-apart life and seeking God&#39;s guidance through fasting and prayer. Our country is in desperate need of repentance, and regular fasting and prayer for the healing of the nation and the upcoming elections is something powerful we can actually *do.* There is an eternal reward of fasting, and it’s not just to have our prayers answered. </p>

			<title><![CDATA[For The Sake of Our Children, Education Must Be of Critical Importance in 2024]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>As we move into 2024, we&#39;re seeing more and more teachers&#39; union representatives talking about comprehensive sex education and why they believe that parents should *not* have the final authority in the lives of their children as it relates to government education and what those kids are being taught. The agenda of the NEA permeates all of our government schools, even those in rural America, and we&#39;re going to look at it specifically. Today, I&#39;m going to focus on education and why I think it should be the preeminent issue in the 2024 elections and in the hearts and minds of parents. I implore you, for the sake of our children, to hear my heart on this issue.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Anyone who has been a parent of a teen for ten minutes knows it can come with a whole lot of goodness, but also some tension, especially as we prepare to launch them. That brings a requirement that we give them opportunities to fail so they have a soft landing with us. Going to public school so they can play sports, getting a job at an early age, having a cell phone… all of these are opportunities for success or failure, and the answer isn’t the same for each child. Listen in today as I talk through some ways you can approach these situations with your teen.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Biden family never ceases to disappoint us. At least now we see we’re not the only ones as a recent poll shows him even further underwater, likely because of his lack of border security, the state of our economy and his gaslighting us on it, and now his recent White House holiday shenanigans. | The country is tiring of being asked to tip every time we turn around, especially as rising prices (mainly due to $15 minimum wages) already strap our wallets. | The Pope blesses same-sex marriages. | But we don’t end there. None of this is out of the Lord’s hand, and we do not put our hope in any world leader. We trust in the Name of the Lord Our God, so we are encouraged!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Hang around for Happy Hour. I mentioned in the show the egregious violation of our Senate Hearing Room, and I’m going to discuss it more. The root issue is sexual sin and how our culture is embracing it. We are in a country that is run by many depraved immoral lunatics - on both sides of the aisle. But do not despair. We respond to this by zealously sharing the love of Christ at every opportunity. That is what we are here for!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tracy and Bernard Tourneur are fighting for their freedom to homeschool in France. They have been denied authorization to homeschool their son under a new law that was initially aimed at combating radical Islamism. It’s important for people in the United States and around the world to pay attention to homeschool freedom issues, as laws and policies in other countries can influence the homeschooling environment globally.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Tracy and Bernard Tourneur are fighting for their freedom to homeschool in France. They have been denied authorization to homeschool their son under a new law that was initially aimed at combating radical Islamism. It’s important for people in the United States and around the world to pay attention to homeschool freedom issues, as laws and policies in other countries can influence the homeschooling environment globally. Join Tracy and HSLDA’s Kevin Boden as we talk about how we can be diligent to protect the homeschooling freedoms that have been fought for on our own soil and learn how you can help.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It can be really hard to hang in there toward the end of your homeschool career. Whether it’s one child or five, once we see the light at the end it can just be hard to finish well. Our children often ask to go to a traditional school, independent attitudes can show themselves, parenting differences appear as the kids get older, and frankly we can just get tired. If you find yourself in this position, it’s critical to revisit why you decided to homeschool in the first place. It can make all the difference!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Will We Obey God Or Sympathize With Israel’s Enemies?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Two months ago, educators and Jewish leaders sounded the alarm on what they were calling an outbreak of anti-Semitism on our college campuses. And they spoke out against faculty and students who displayed what they called a complete lack of empathy following the Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel on the 7th of October. </p>
<p>We saw just a few days ago on December 5th, a horrifying reality when some of our so-called elite university presidents at Harvard, MIT, and UPenn were questioned by Congress regarding their views on antisemitism. I&#39;m going to play a little bit of their remarks for you today and we’ll dig into this issue together.</p>

<p>Stick around for Happy Hour where I’m answering a few more questions. I’m talking about giving money to everyone who asks, whether or not Proverbs 22:6 is a promise, and how to handle it when we grow in our faith and realize all worship music isn’t Biblical. Join me! </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We are seeing a mass exodus of young adults from the faith, and 70% of students don’t believe in absolute truth. This trend is accelerating rapidly, and we absolutely must stop the train. It’s a matter of eternal significance for children all over the globe. My friend Dave Richardson is here today to talk about the way he teaches students to recognize the assumptions they have, and how to look past them so they will make Biblical choices. It’s an incredibly effective tool, and I’m excited to share it with you today. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Merriam-Webster defines peace as freedom from civil disturbance and freedom from disquieting or oppressive thoughts and emotions. As we look around the world today, we can see that we have anything but peace–we have just the opposite–and yet in the midst of panic, in the midst of perilous times, the word of God offers us peace. We&#39;re going to spend a little bit of time talking today about the peace of God and how you can have it reign in your heart this holiday season and throughout the new year.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Family Devotions: The Easy Button]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The percentage of families who are reading the Bible in their homes is dreadfully low, but we know it’s not because the desire is not there. It’s because we are intimidated, we think we’re not experts, we don’t know enough, we don’t have time to make the habit, you get the idea. There are plenty of excuses, but it is a matter of eternity that we start reading the Word with our children. Don’t miss my visit with my friend Glenn Ransom as he comes to share his easy button for family devotions with us. You’ll love it! </p>

			<title><![CDATA[The Difficult, But Critical, Practice of Rest]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>
</p>
<p>Our bodies and souls are so desperate for rest, but some of us do this more easily than others. People who are Doers by nature, often Do something for rest, but I think that&#39;s not actually rest. It is out of an overflow that we serve others, so our impact is diminished when we don&#39;t take time for rest. (I&#39;m just talking to myself today, so feel free to listen in!) The Lord talks about it in the Bible, Jesus practiced it as a man, and we need to commit to it as Christ followers. Let&#39;s talk about how to implement it.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Homeschooling in France is Now Nearly Impossible]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today I am joined by Tracy Tourneur, an American married to a wonderful Frenchman. They have been homeschooling in France until, under the direction of President Macron, they were denied this fundamental right. This is yet another example of how the left is attempting to separate children from their parents and deny the basic fundamental rights of parents to direct the upbringing of their children and a chilling look into coming struggles for the United States. </p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Today I am joined by Tracy Tourneur, an American married to a wonderful Frenchman. They have been homeschooling in France until, under the direction of President Macron, they were denied this fundamental right. This is yet another example of how the left is attempting to separate children from their parents and deny the basic fundamental rights of parents to direct the upbringing of their children and a chilling look into coming struggles for the United States. &lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The past week has been horrific for Israel. The evil attacks by Hamas, the brutal killing of innocent civilians and the pleasure they take in it should be unilaterally condemned in the United States. But in our Universities and in our major cities, Hamas&#39; brutality is being celebrated. God warned that there would be unrest in this part of the country—a never ending struggle between the descendants of Isaac and of Ishmael. But has God&#39;s heart toward Israel changed? And how should Christians respond? Show Notes: <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/is-israel-gods-chosen-nation">http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/is-israel-gods-chosen-nation</a>

			<title><![CDATA[Land of the Free? Homeschooling Family in TN Threatened with Deportation]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Congress Can Stop Deportation for Romeikes—But We Need Your Help!https://hslda.org/post/congress-can-stop-deportation-for-romeikes-but-we-need-your-help

Fleeing Germany in 2008 because they did not have the freedom to homeschool their five children, they came to America seeking asylum. They have been here since then, contributing to and blessing their community. At their required immigration check-in in September, they were surprisingly told to get German passports to prepare for self-deportation. They have no idea why, and now face the fracture of their family as two of their children are now married to American citizens and one has their first child. To be clear, they have been here legally all along.</p>
<p>Congress has stepped in in the past, and we are asking them now to do the same so this family can enjoy the freedom to homeschool that we all can appreciate. Join me today with Uwe and Hannelore Romeike and their attorney Kevin Boden as we talk about their story and how we can help. </p>

			<title><![CDATA[The Outsourcing of Parenting]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For generations in the United States and in most western cultures, we have outsourced 90% of the training of our children. We send our kids to Sunday School so they can be trained in the Bible, we send them to public or Christian schools for their academic training, and we get them at breakfast and dinner to begin and end the day. No wonder we’re losing our kids. Today I’ll be talking about why this has to change.

			<title><![CDATA[#ReplayThursday | Christianity + Yoga: Do They Mix?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>[Listener Favorites Replay] Should Christianity mix with yoga? Are yoga poses benign if we do them but don&#39;t engage in the spiritual practice behind them? This is the question I&#39;m asking my guest, Jessica Smith, who taught yoga for many years. Jessica has a unique perspective and a solid biblical stance on this modern controversy. Yoga is one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophical traditions, yet many Christians today are practicing yoga with the belief that yoga&#39;s deep ties to Hinduism and Buddhism can be avoided. I will confess, I thought the same thing—but not any longer. Jessica challenged me and opened my eyes to the truth about this topic. Listen in. I pray your heart is blessed and encouraged as you strive to know God in a deeper way and bring Him honor in everything you do. Show Notes (find part two as well) :

			<description><![CDATA[<p>As the Republican landscape shapes up for 2024, I feel a warning must be issued: the in-fighting, the bullying, the lack of a cohesive vision for the future… is all very troubling. The Republican party lacks true statesmen leaders—and as a result, we have descended into partisan tribalism. Unity is not found in canceling fellow Conservatives or in political elitism on either side of the aisle.

Her new project, &amp;quot;I am worthy&amp;quot; speaks to students about the identity crisis from the vantage point of truth. The truth is that everyone has worth.

Ordinary Americans are afraid of sharing their point-of-view because they are afraid of losing their job or tenure. Totalitarianism is casting a dark shadow over the west and we have a moment to recognize it and prepare for it.

			<title><![CDATA[Political Witch Hunts and the Power of Our Words]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>It seems like we have entered some sort of a weird dystopian time in the United States where what we used to believe about our country is in question. I watched on the news yesterday as Rudy Giuliani turned himself in the political prosecution of Donald Trump. Guliani is 79 years old—and he was indicted last week along with Trump and 17 other individuals. This is a political witch hunt. It tells us a lot about the state of our union... and yet in the midst of all this, God&#39;s word remains the same. Today we&#39;ll be looking at the headlines and how our words can bring hurt... or healing. SHOW NOTES:

			<title><![CDATA[A {Beautiful} Mess: The Solution to Favoritism in Families ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Families are messy, aren’t they? One of the reasons I love the bible so much is that we get to see the messy side of all the characters …. Including bad parenting. God included these accounts so that we can learn lessons from these real people—lessons about the use of trickery, favoritism in families, deciding to run ahead of God, misunderstanding what God is doing, parental manipulation and more. We can take so many good things away from the parenting mistakes that were made by Abraham, Isaac and Jacob! God redeems our messes when we offer them to Him. <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/broken-beautiful-god-redeems-all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>God’s design of male and female is a beautiful one. We were created in the image of God to function differently — but we are of equal worth in the eyes of our Creator. God has given us a clear chain of command in Scripture, starting with God the Father. When we do not honor God’s clear chain of authority, anarchy results. Today, we’re looking at creation and how God has given us different roles from the beginning. We are called to humility as men and women under authority, submitted to our head, which is Christ. Join me and my guest, Pastor Phil Hopper for this thoughtful and biblical discussion! <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/no-authority-anarchy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;God’s design of male and female is a beautiful one. We were created in the image of God to function differently — but we are of equal worth in the eyes of our Creator. God has given us a clear chain of command in Scripture, starting with God the Father. When we do not honor God’s clear chain of authority, anarchy results. Today, we’re looking at creation and how God has given us different roles from the beginning. We are called to humility as men and women under authority, submitted to our head, which is Christ. Join me and my guest, Pastor Phil Hopper for this thoughtful and biblical discussion! &lt;a href=&quot;http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/no-authority-anarchy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferer&quot;&gt;SHOW NOTES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Shiny, Not-So-Happy People: A Legacy of Legalism]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>By now, many of you have seen the documentary on the Duggar family, &quot;Shiny Happy People.&quot; As a woman who grew up under spiritual abuse, I am glad to see any form of abuse unearthed and exposed. Rules without relationship injure people, and the legalistic way in which Gothard and others like him control people using the Bible as their excuse to do so is wrong. However, I believe this was the wrong way to expose it. This documentary was salivating at the chance to give Christians stones to throw at people — even those who did not deserve it—and that&#39;s exactly what they got. Today I&#39;ll be sharing my thoughts and directing us back to the gospel that changes us. <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/shiny-not-so-happy-people-legacy-legalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>You guys hear me talk a lot about 501(c)(3)s, and a listener asked for some specifics. What does that status really mean, and is it a blessing or a hindrance? Or maybe both? We see churches these days hide behind it and choose not to address difficult issues in the name of not being “political.” But what is really required to maintain that status, and is it becoming an idol?

The result of this misguided approach is obvious: Politics is now a stronghold of &quot;spiritual forces of evil in heavenly places.&quot; We can&#39;t see when angels and demons are battling against each other—if we did it would absolutely change our posture toward prayer and we would take our place on the battlefield. Our Constitution was written for moral people. The church at large absolutely must take part in our civic process. If not Christians, who do you think is representing a Biblical Worldview?</p>
<p>Two Kingdoms: But we can be sure that both spiritual powers are at work consistently. One marches to God&#39;s orders and the other follows Satan&#39;s command.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It has been made very clear that government organizations can not be trusted. As the CEO of our own homes, we must find voices to learn from who have been proven in history. We can never again blindly participate in untested medical experiments. The powers that be must know that we the people have eyes wide open and will hold them accountable for their actions. At the end of the day, we are not helpless, nor hopeless. We will not comply, and we will not live in fear.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately in our fallen world, sin takes over and all the good intentions of one spouse cannot overcome the abuse of the other. It’s hard for many women to know when the line has been crossed from difficult to just plain abusive, and I have a unique perspective as someone who grew up in an abusive home. Unfortunately the church hasn’t been very helpful in this arena, but I believe we can do better.

			<title><![CDATA[Thriving As A Caregiver For Someone With Anxiety, Depression, and Suicidal Thoughts ]]></title>

			<title><![CDATA[Homeschooling in the Crosshairs Of The Secular Media]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>
</p>
<p>The homeschooling movement is again in the crosshairs of the secular media, put there by a couple who was raised in the home of what appear to be hardcore, legalistic parents. No doubt there are sinners in the homeschooling movement, and some of those were even leaders. But do we shut down or overregulate an entire movement because of the sins of a small percentage? And if that&#39;s the case, find me a schooling situation that doesn&#39;t have any abusers in it and we&#39;ll talk. </p>
<p>Abuse is tragic regardless of the situation, and it should never be swept under the rug. That said, let&#39;s talk about what homeschooling really *is* to almost every homeschooling family and why I firmly believe it is the best option for all of our children. <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/homeschooling-crosshairs-secular-media" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

			<title><![CDATA[Should Parents Shelter their Children?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>I've seen more videos than I can take lately of parents taking their young children to drag shows, and allowing them to be exposed to sexually charged material—but on the other side of the issue are Christian parents who are often chided as being "over-protective." Today, I'll be discussing what God says about the role of parents and the outcomes of godly shepherding. Today's podcast is taken in part from my Bible study "Irreplaceable: The Life-Giving, Soul-Steadying Role of Mothers. " You can join this study by going to momstronginternational.com | <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/parents-shelter-children" target="_blank">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve seen more videos than I can take lately of parents taking their young children to drag shows, and allowing them to be exposed to sexually charged material—but on the other side of the issue are Christian parents who are often chided as being &quot;over-protective.&quot; Today, I&apos;ll be discussing what God says about the role of parents and the outcomes of godly shepherding. Today&apos;s podcast is taken in part from my Bible study &quot;Irreplaceable: The Life-Giving, Soul-Steadying Role of Mothers. &quot; You can join this study by going to momstronginternational.com | &lt;a href=&quot;http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/parents-shelter-children&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SHOW NOTES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[The Woke, Evil "Science" of Transgenderism is Hurting Our Kids and Our Culture]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Many Americans today have accepted what seemed totally ludicrous just a generation ago: that gender is a social construct, and that you can be born in the "wrong body." What's worse, is that our schools are pushing this onto vulnerable and impressionable young people at a devastating cost. &nbsp;As sad, and scary as this is, there is hope as more and more “detransitioners” are allowing their stories to be told. Today, we’ll highlight why it's so important to understand the history of the trans movement and expose it. <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/evil-science-transgenderism-hurting-kids-culture" target="_blank">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

			<title><![CDATA[Catholicism and Protestantism, Important Distinctions | Suffering and the Will of God]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this season of Lent, I tend to get questions regarding Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. Today, I'll be discussing some very important distinctions between the two and finally, answering the question, can a practicing Catholic be "born again?" I squeezed in one more question on suffering and the will of God. Remember, if you have accepted Christ as your Savior, you have the indwelling power of the Holy Spirit. You can, and should, open the Bible for yourself. God wants to speak to you! <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/catholicism-protestantism-important-distinctions-suffering-will-god" target="_blank">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

			<title><![CDATA[The Story of the White Rose Resistance with Seth Gruber]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>During the holocaust, 21 year old Sophie Scholl was beheaded for standing against Hitler’s evil regime. She said, “The real damage is done by those millions who want to 'survive.' The honest men who just want to be left in peace. Those who don’t want their little lives disturbed by anything bigger than themselves. Those with no sides and no causes. Those who won’t take measure of their own strength, for fear of antagonizing their own weakness. Those who don’t like to make waves—or enemies. Those for whom freedom, honour, truth, and principles are only literature. Those who live small, mate small, die small. It’s the reductionist approach to life: if you keep it small, you’ll keep it under control. If you don’t make any noise, the bogeyman won’t find you. But it’s all an illusion, because they die too, those people who roll up their spirits into tiny little balls so as to be safe. Safe?! From what? Life is always on the edge of death; narrow streets lead to the same place as wide avenues, and a little candle burns itself out just like a flaming torch does. I choose my own way to burn.”― <strong>Sophie Scholl</strong>, .</p>
<p>Today, Seth and Heidi will challenge listeners to take a page from the life story of this brave young woman and choose service over safety.&nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[The White Rose Resistance with Seth Gruber]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>“If you know, why do you not act?” Seth Gruber, abortion abolitionist joins me to end this year’s podcast with a plea: <em>do something</em> to stop the brutal killing of unborn babies. There is no reason for our unborn to be slaughtered in the womb, aside from our passivity and cowardice. 2023 is here. It’s time to exercise our faith and choose who we will serve. This is a powerful interview… not for the easily offended, as Seth encourages you to get off the bench and onto the battlefield that is abortion. <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/white-rose-resistance-seth-gruber" target="_blank">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

Today, I am blessed to have all of my kids in the studio to talk about what it was like to be homeschooled—would they homeschool their own kids, what about socialization, what their biggest “takeaways” about homeschooling were and more.

			<title><![CDATA[How to Shepherd a Disrespectful Teen | Living with a Complaining Spouse | A Biblical Response to Homosexuality]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>There is a shift happening among Christians and it is occurring in many churches, not just so-called Progressive churches. Many Christians claim that the Bible doesn’t forbid homosexual activity or that its commands aren’t valid for today, but rather that is was simply a reflection of the culture in which the Bible was written.</p>
<p>So how can we know God’s heart? &nbsp;We have to know what He thinks. So how do we find out what God thinks? The Christian says to look in the Bible. God’s Word is clear: the Bible tells us that God forbids homosexual acts. Therefore, they are wrong. It’s important to remember that sexual sin is no worse than any other sin—but the question of premeditation makes it a serious one.</p>
<p>Christians, we must adhere to God’s Word in every area of our lives. When we stray outside God’s boundaries, we forfeit His blessing.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;There is a shift happening among Christians and it is occurring in many churches, not just so-called Progressive churches. Many Christians claim that the Bible doesn’t forbid homosexual activity or that its commands aren’t valid for today, but rather that is was simply a reflection of the culture in which the Bible was written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can we know God’s heart? &amp;nbsp;We have to know what He thinks. So how do we find out what God thinks? The Christian says to look in the Bible. God’s Word is clear: the Bible tells us that God forbids homosexual acts. Therefore, they are wrong. It’s important to remember that sexual sin is no worse than any other sin—but the question of premeditation makes it a serious one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians, we must adhere to God’s Word in every area of our lives. When we stray outside God’s boundaries, we forfeit His blessing. Today I’ll be addressing this topic and several other issues from a Biblical point of view. &lt;a href=&quot;http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/teens-spouse-homosexuality&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SHOW NOTES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Republicans lost “bigly” compared with expectations of the forecasted “red tsunami”— but why? The answers aren’t easy, but they are increasingly obvious; we need new leadership in the Republican party. Also, the question about God’s judgment on the United States comes up frequently. Today I’ll address it in light of our most recent votes to deny medical care to newborns who are either unwanted or dying, and to California’s brazen disdain for the rights of the unborn. <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/conservatives-fumble-god-judgment" target="_blank">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

			<title><![CDATA[NO COVID AMNESTY: Not Now, Not Ever]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The past two and a half years have been some of the most difficult our nation has ever faced. A virus with a 99.9% survival rate was used to ignore our Constitution and impose tyranny on peaceful citizens. At fault? The President of the United States, unelected bureaucrats, and power-hungry governors who misused their power to bring the American people to their knees emotionally and financially. Now that the truth is finally being talked about in the open (because yes, the suppression of free speech was part of the tyranny of the past two years) — those who yelled at the unvaccinated, fired them, and otherwise treated anyone who questioned the narrative with disdain want us to forget it ever happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can never forget. There must be justice and there must be consequences —because if we do not hold these people accountable for willfully lying to us, this will happen again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can never forget what they did. We must never forget the people who died alone, the children who lost out on their education, the graduations that will never happen, the mass psychosis, and the people who died as a result of being forced to take an experimental shot. The response to Covid by our nation was criminal. It should be treated that way.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Climate Crisis? Or Global Agenda? with Jeremy Baker]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Washington State is leading the way in making life increasingly unaffordable for most working-class families. Take their “clean energy” plan (passed in 2019), which effectively eliminates natural gas from retail sales by 2045. The result? Consumers are forced to use less effective and more expensive types of energy to heat their homes. The zealous push to fundamentally transform our state’s use of fossil fuels exports our industry to far away countries with far less regulations on pollution, effectively giving those countries the benefits of our good paying jobs while providing negligible benefits for the environment. Eliminating fossil fuel use before proven technologies are viable risks less reliable and more expensive energy system.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>With rising inflation and crime at an all-time high, many people around the nation are getting “off the bench” and running for office. Today, I’m honored to be joined by Jeremy Baker, a father of four boys who decided to run for state representative here in WA’s 49th LD. As a former Marine, Jeremy brings a refreshing motto to politics regarding what to do when you sense danger: stop, identify the threat, rush and overwhelm it. Today’s threat?

			<title><![CDATA[Covid, Coercion, and a Cover-Up: Where Do We Go From Here?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Every day, it seems like there are more and more people coming out of the woodwork to say “maybe, just maybe, we got it wrong.” For those of us who spent the last two years being harassed, yelled at, shunned, bullied, and even spit on (in the case of my sister, who refused to wear a mask in the grocery store) the feeling of being “vindicated” pales in comparison to what we have lost. Whether forced to take a rushed-to-market “cure” or terminated from work, kicked out of college, or worse, we have a choice to make: how do we move past such a devastating time? &nbsp;The Bible is clear that we are to forgive those who have wronged us. God’s Word offers hope—and in today’s episode, I’ll be sharing some listener stories and pointing to the healing balm of Scripture. <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/covid-where-go-from-here" target="_blank">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Lots to talk about on the show today:&nbsp;</p>
<p>—Many in the United States have felt the Brits were “overreacting” to the death of the late Queen Elizabeth, but I disagree. A life devoted to country and family is worth honoring. They got it right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>—CEO of “Beyond Meat” has a story that you can’t make up and finally…Proverbs 22:6 says, &nbsp;“Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it.” However, many parents today are struggling to discipline their children with any manner of consistently. Not only does this go against Scripture, but it is also harming our children.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Despite the government schools' blatant agenda of woke, gender-bending, sexual and racial indoctrination, many &nbsp;Christian parents in conservative states believe their children are not being targeted in their public school. “My child is in a good school district” is one line that my guest, Karen England hears all the time in her home state of Tennessee.

			<title><![CDATA[Title IX]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>How concerned should we be that the Biden Administration wants to bypass Congress and re-write the 1972 Anti-Discrimination act for schools? Answer: VERY CONCERNED. Even the New York Post is worried about its impact, saying “Biden’s new Title IX rules deputize teachers to override parents on gender identity.” Team Biden’s proposed new Title IX regulations make it clear: They’re coming for your children. The administration ostensibly drafted the rules to protect gay and transgender students from bullying and harassment, but they do nothing of the sort. In reality, President Biden is handing teachers a weapon to subvert parental prerogatives. This change has far-reaching implications. One is that it will be used to keep parents in the dark on everything from curricular material to the fact that a child is socially transitioning at school. Today I’ll be discussing why you MUST get involved to prevent this assault against our kids through the public school system. <strong>THE DEADLINE TO SUBMIT A PUBLIC COMMENT IS SEPTEMBER 12TH. Find out how: </strong><a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/title-ix" target="_blank"><strong>SHOW NOTES</strong></a></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>With the recent reversal of Roe, the pro-life movement has gained new momentum. Ultrasound technology, science and the Bible agree: life begins at conception. This is not stopping states like California from attempting to become “sanctuary” states for abortion as the fight for life heats up. So what is the future of the pro-life movement?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today I’m tackling questions from listeners! A “pastor” in Florida is teaching that homosexuality is “holy” and that God holds it in high regard. Sadly, this kind of teaching is growing in the modern progressive church. The intended effect of so-called “revisionist gay theology” is to disengage the church from the wider cultural debate about homosexuality by redefining it as God-ordained and morally permissible. And just like the serpent’s temptation to Eve in the Garden, leaders in the “gay-Christian” movement are tempting us with the question: “Did God <em>really</em> say…that homosexuality is a sin?” <a href="ttp://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/listener-questions-2">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

			<title><![CDATA[How Modern Feminism is Making Men AND Women Miserable]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s feminist movement bears little to no resemblance to the movement that was rallying women together for basic human rights: the right to vote, to own a business for example. Many women today have bought into the lie that feminism will empower and free them. The so-called “Women’s March” is an angry group of women who scream their abortions, and deny the God-given roles of men and women. Its attempt to dismantle the family unit will bring neither power nor freedom. Men and women are different by design. Let’s celebrate our differences and stop trying to pretend they don’t exist. <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/modern-feminism-miserable" target="_blank">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Today’s feminist movement bears little to no resemblance to the movement that was rallying women together for basic human rights: the right to vote, to own a business for example. Many women today have bought into the lie that feminism will empower and free them. The so-called “Women’s March” is an angry group of women who scream their abortions, and deny the God-given roles of men and women. Its attempt to dismantle the family unit will bring neither power nor freedom. Men and women are different by design. Let’s celebrate our differences and stop trying to pretend they don’t exist. &lt;a href=&quot;http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/modern-feminism-miserable&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SHOW NOTES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[The Truth About Public School Starts Here: Education is Not Neutral]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, Babylon Bee put out a satirical headline that struck a little to close to home for many people when it showed a picture of a yellow school bus dropping kids off and declared, “Thousands of Kindergarteners Dropped off Across the Nation for First Day of Grooming.” Before you get offended, consider this: Parents are putting their kids on these buses, and sending them to places that are teaching them that their gender is malleable, that God doesn’t exist, and that the earth is on a collision course thanks to “climate change.“ Government schools are teaching false history, creating social activists and kids who don’t know how blessed they are to live in America. Education is not neutral! Listen in as I talk about this very important topic. <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/truth-public-school-education-not-neutral" target="_blank">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever struggled through seasons of disappointment, distress or discouragement? My hunch is that, like me and so many others, you have. The apostle Paul was no stranger to suffering and yet, he often spoke of living in the “fullness of joy.” Corrie Ten Boom, who suffered under the Nazis and lost most of her family in the holocaust said, “Joy is not a product of your circumstances. It is the unmistakable sign of the presence of God.” Today, I’ll be sharing some thoughts on why I Christians should be known as people of joy… no matter what they are facing. Strength is found in the joy of the Lord! <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/living-joy-filled-life" target="_blank">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

The Bible teaches us that fear is a spirit and that it is not from God. So what to do? How can we live free from fear and walk in newness of life in Christ? How can we teach our children what it looks like to walk in peace regardless of what’s happening around us?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Is yoga harmless? Is it just another form of exercise, or is the strong spiritual component of yoga something Christians should be wary of? Yoga means "to yoke" or to open oneself up and invite in the spirit of yoga. Yoga sutras are a basically a guidebook for divination, which God expressly prohibits in the Bible. Listen in as Jessica Smith makes a strong case for how the poses alone invite spiritual forces into our lives that have no place in the lives of Christ followers. The Bible says, "You shall have no other God's before Me."

			<title><![CDATA[Christianity and Yoga: Do They Mix? with Jessica Smith]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Should Christianity mix with yoga? Are yoga poses benign if we do them but don't engage in the spiritual practice behind them? This is the question I'm asking my guest, Jessica Smith, who taught yoga for many years. Jessica has a unique perspective and a solid biblical stance on this modern controversy. Yoga is one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophical traditions, yet many Christians today are practicing yoga with the belief that yoga's deep ties to Hinduism and Buddhism can be avoided. I will confess, I thought the same thing—but not any longer. Jessica challenged me and opened my eyes to the truth about this topic. Listen in. I pray your heart is blessed and encouraged as you strive to know God in a deeper way and bring Him honor in everything you do. <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/christianity-yoga-jessica-smith" target="_blank">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

			<title><![CDATA[ANYONE CAN HOMESCHOOL]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>If you knew that there was a deadly virus at your local school, would you send your child there? If you knew there was fierce fighting happening at the school, would you pack a snack lunch for them and send them on their way? Sadly, many parents are still turning a blind eye to the real pandemic - the spiritual and moral crisis that’s taking our youth in record numbers is happening in the public schools. The battle is real—and our kids should never be on the front lines. My hunch is that you wouldn’t. The time for excuses is over. The schools are no longer safe places for our kids. It’s time to pull them out. <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/anyone-can-homeschool " target="_blank">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Harry Alicea was born in the late 80’s to a drug addicted mother. As a result, he was also born addicted to cocaine and suffered from a cleft palate. At two years old, he went into the foster care system. He was never adopted. Today, Harry shares his story of abuse and abandonment, and ultimately, healing, because of Christ. In a culture that encourages victimhood, Harry experienced victory. Today, he is a father, a business owner and a devoted husband. He reminds us that we don’t need to be victims of our circumstances. We can rise above them and bring the hope and healing of Christ to a new generation. <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/life-hard-god-good-harry-alicea" target="_blank"><strong>SHOW NOTES</strong></a></p>

We do not have to wait until tragedy strikes before we send our “thoughts and prayers.” Let’s raise a prayer shield in this Nation to COVER our children before they head back to school. It won’t be political parties, politicians, or pretty social media posts that shift the spiritual atmosphere of the nation; it will be praying mamas from every corner, of each state, praying for the Lord to rend the heavens and come down on behalf of our children! &nbsp;Today, Donna Martin, founder of GirlTruth.org, joins me to talk about the fight for our children and why prayer must be our first line of defense. <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/donna-martin" target="_blank">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

			<title><![CDATA[Belief in the Inerrancy of Scripture: Does It Matter?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>“Fake news.” We live in a time that tends toward believing that truth is subjective, and that people can have “their truth” instead of asking, like Pilate, “What is truth?” Sadly, some Christians today seem to be comfortable with the false notion that the Bible is like any other book, and that it, too, contains errors. This is an alarming belief, because it asserts that some of the Bible is true, and some is not. Further, the notion that “There is truth, but we cannot know it” is driving people away from the concept of absolute truth, and that’s a dangerous place for Christians to be. Why? Because truth matters. God’s Word claims to be truth, in keeping with the character and omniscient nature of God. In an age of “fake news,” perhaps, we have simply gotten used to being lied to. However, the Bible stands alone without error. This essential doctrine is a cornerstone of the Christian faith. Inerrancy deserves high regard among evangelicals and has rightly earned the status of being essential to the Christian Faith. <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/inerrancy-scripture-matter" target="_blank">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

			<title><![CDATA[What Does the Bible Say About Permanent Birth Control]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>An anonymous listener is struggling in her marriage because of a disagreement over permanent birth control. While there are no direct and easy answers to this issue, one thing is certain: God cares about children. He says they are “a blessing.” There are equally committed Christians with strong opinions on both sides of the issue, but the fact remains that the Bible does not directly address all of the moral and spiritual implications of many modern medical procedures such as vasectomy and tubal ligation. Today, I’ll be talking about what matters most, starting with protecting unity inside of marriage, especially in issues regarding children. <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/bible-permanent-birth-control" target="_blank">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A young listener is asking about the practice of witchcraft and whether or not it’s okay to use crystals. According to the Bible, this is dangerous territory! Some people believe that crystals have an inherent power that can be harnessed and used to their benefit—but God’s Word is clear: none of these superstitious beliefs about crystals come from the Bible. The Bible warns strongly against engaging in anything related to the occult, and crystals definitely fall into that category. <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/christians-crystals-what-bible-say" target="_blank">SHOW NOTES</a></p>

The Bible warns strongly against engaging in anything related to the occult, and crystals definitely fall into that category. &lt;a href=&quot;http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/christians-crystals-what-bible-say&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SHOW NOTES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Straight Pride? What God says About Pride]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is a very confusing time to shepherd children. Every day, I interact with parents who are struggling to navigate the turbulent waters of a culture in spiritual crisis. In five minutes on social media, you’re likely to see articles sowing seeds of confusion and doubt on anything related to Christian values. No time is this more prevalent than the month of June, which has been set aside to celebrate what God says will bring suffering and sorrow. But is the answer to “gay pride” “straight pride?” God’s Word says pride that focuses on us is never pleasing to God. The Bible teaches us that Satan is a master deceiver. From the time of Eve, the devil has been delighting in misleading human beings. Turns out that like Eve, we are easily deceived. In every generation, there are false teachers whom Satan uses to sow seeds of confusion and draw us away from the truth. Shepherding children in the midst of this can make us fearful of our sons and daughters being led astray. SHOW NOTES</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever had a really bad moment? A moment when you let yourself down and others who depended on you? A moment when you were not your best self? A moment that would embarrass you if others knew? Even as I type these words, I am convicted by those moments in my life. Peter had a moment like that in Luke 22. Some might say Peter was the brash disciple; he rushed in with answers and jumped out of a boat only to take his eyes off Jesus and begin to sink. Peter pledged with great boldness that he was ready to go anywhere with his friend and mentor, Jesus, even to death. But in Luke 22, Peter denied not once, but three times that he even knew Jesus. Why? In part, because of fear.</p>

In this replay, I’ll be sharing the discovery that changed the way I homeschooled.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Turning the Tide in Public Education with Sheri Few]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Many people don’t realize how long the public schools have been in trouble. Sheri Few does. Twenty years ago, as a concerned parent of three boys in public schools, Sheri Few founded South Carolina Parents Involved in Education (SCPIE), a grassroots organization committed to education excellence through the meaningful involvement of parents in their children’s education. In 2015, Sheri expanded the organization nationally to become United States Parents Involved in Education (USPIE), which has 20 state chapters and growing. Sheri currently serves as president of USPIE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today we’re focusing on the crisis in our Public Education System and what you can do right now to begin to make a positive difference.</p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come see Heidi March 31-April 2&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://teachthemdiligently.net/invite/809/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teach Them Diligently&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;in Round Rock, TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Cultivating Media Discernment in Kids with Dr. Kathy Koch]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Bias in the media is everywhere in the culture—even in Christian publications.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Essential oils are not just oils, but they are power-packed remedies packed into tiny glass bottles. Well-known for their anti-fungal and anti-microbial qualities, essential oils can help support your body from the inside-out. The aroma of many oils helps to relieve anxiety and stress, and helps us get the sleep we need. The anti-fungal and anti-microbial nature of essential oils have been studied for generations, and show these oils effectively fight against human pathogens. Studies have observed that essential oils, when added to the impure air samples, helped inhibit the growth of airborne bacteria. So, essential oils can indeed be effective in cleaning and purifying the air. But what and how can you use essential oils to clean the air?

			<title><![CDATA[Defeating The Spirit of Confusion: Lessons from Nehemiah]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the next several days, I’ll be drawing on lessons from the powerful leadership story of Nehemiah. It’s not hard to draw striking parallels between his time and ours. We’re up against a lot right now, but God is moving now as He did then. The spirit of confusion is no match for the children of God… our job is to know His voice and follow it!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[When You Can’t See the Outcome: The Blessing of Obedience]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Has God ever asked you to do something that scared you? Has He ever called you to something that didn’t make sense to you in the moment? &nbsp;If so, you’re not alone. Jesus understands. God asked Him to do the unthinkable: to go to the cross for you and for me—but the result of Christ’s obedience to the Father has resulted in amazing blessing for you and me. Lately I have been thinking about the blessings of obedience. Truth is, God’s blessings are found there. His blessings are not found outside His boundaries. The question is not whether or not we should obey, the question is <em>how </em>do we obey, even when we don’t see the outcome! If you’re struggling with grumbling or complaining as you obey, you’re missing a very important part of obedience. Listen in and find out more!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Can We Reconcile Admonishment and Unity? ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>“Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity!” &nbsp;&nbsp;Psalm 133:1 ESV</p>
<p>We were created to dwell in unity as believers, and the absence of that unity can be painful. Nothing has exposed us more to disunity in recent years than the rhetoric and divisiveness we see in culture right right. When division comes between close friends and family, it can be heartbreaking. Does this mean that we overlook false teaching or unsound doctrine in the name of getting along? Of course not.</p>
<p>Paul wrote extensively about the importance of unity in the book of Ephesians. But he also warned the elders of the Ephesian church when he spoke to them in person:</p>
<p>“I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock; and from among your own selves will arise men speaking twisted things, to draw away the disciples after them. Therefore, be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish everyone with tears.” Acts 20:29-31</p>
<p>Can we reconcile admonishment and unity? The Bible teaches a resounding “yes!”</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Called and Gifted for Such a Time as This... Yes, You Are]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>“I’m leaving.” That’s what my friend said to me some months ago as she surveyed the political and spiritual landscape here in the pacific northwest. “You have the gift of fighting. I do not.” &nbsp;It was like a hammer to my heart. Why would anyone leave the fighting to someone else? Don’t we all have a part to play? Why are we running?</p>
<p>The questions kept coming.</p>
<p>My heart has been heavy lately over the number of people who I see fleeing instead of fighting. And while I realize that God calls us all to different things—I have come to question this exodus off the Battlefield. God has gifted us all, for such a time as this.</p>
<p>“There are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but the same Spirit is the source of them all. <strong>5 </strong>There are different kinds of service, but we serve the same Lord. <strong>6 </strong>God works in different ways, but it is the same God who does the work in all of us.<strong>7 </strong>A spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help each other.” 1 Cor 12:4-7</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;“I’m leaving.” That’s what my friend said to me some months ago as she surveyed the political and spiritual landscape here in the pacific northwest. “You have the gift of fighting. I do not.” &amp;nbsp;It was like a hammer to my heart. Why would anyone leave the fighting to someone else? Don’t we all have a part to play? Why are we running?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions kept coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart has been heavy lately over the number of people who I see fleeing instead of fighting. And while I realize that God calls us all to different things—I have come to question this exodus off the Battlefield. God has gifted us all, for such a time as this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but the same Spirit is the source of them all. &lt;strong&gt;5 &lt;/strong&gt;There are different kinds of service, but we serve the same Lord. &lt;strong&gt;6 &lt;/strong&gt;God works in different ways, but it is the same God who does the work in all of us.&lt;strong&gt;7 &lt;/strong&gt;A spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help each other.” 1 Cor 12:4-7&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We're just like the ancient Israelites, aren’t we? Think about it: according to the Bible, why did nations fall? Because they turned away from God. That's what's happening in in the United States right now. It's certainly what's happening in Europe. Today we’ll look at 1 Corinthians 10 and discuss the huge issues of their time. For example, they were ah deep into sexual sin. It was inside the church also! Today, like in the days of the Apostle Paul, the church has either largely ignored or offered unsound biblical counsel.</p>
<p>Though the Israelites had the covenant blessings and were miraculously delivered and sustained as we have been here in America,&nbsp; most of them died in the wilderness because of disobedience and unbelief.&nbsp; If we want God’s blessing, we better pay attention to His boundaries.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Don’t Let a Lie Be Our Legacy: Four Ways You Can Reflect The Truth]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In the ancient writings of Ezra, the scribe, we read: "Ezra had determined to study and obey the Law of the LORD and to teach those decrees and regulations to the people of Israel" (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nlt/Ezra%207.10"><u>Ezra 7:10 NLT</u></a>).In the New Testament, the theme continued. Paul’s words to the church in Colossae continue to resound in today’s skeptical culture: “See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ” (<a href="https://www.esv.org/Col.%202%3A8/"><u>Col. 2:8</u></a>). &nbsp;So what’s a Christian to do? It’s clear: speak and teach the truth. <a href="https://tuttletwins.com/ref/heidi/" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Turtle Twins</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.mypillow.com/heidi" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Visit MyPillow</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.fphrc.org/start-your-own" target="_blank"><strong>Resource Center Info</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/legacy-reflect-truth" target="_blank"><strong>Find the show notes here</strong></a></p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ominous Overtones: the Reichstag Fire and January 6th with Rick Green]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On February 27 1933, as Hitler’s campaign moved into its final, frantic days, the Reichstag, the German Parliament building, was set on fire and burnt down. An atmosphere of panic and terror followed the event. This continued when a young Dutch communist, Van der Lubbe was arrested for the crime. Though the event had been wildly exaggerated, the Nazi Party used the atmosphere of panic to their advantage, using it to sway political sentiment towards their movement. This hysteria helped to turn the public against the communists, one of the Nazis main opponents, and 4000 people were imprisoned.</p>
<p>On the 28 February 1933, President Hindenburg signed the Emergency Decree for the Protection of the German People. This decree suspended the democratic aspects of the Weimar Republic and declared a state of emergency. This decree gave the Nazis a legal basis for the persecution and oppression of any opponents, who were be framed as traitors to the republic. People could be imprisoned for any or no reason.</p>
<p>The decree also removed basic personal freedoms, such as the freedom of speech, the right to own property, and the right to trial before imprisonment.</p>
<p>Today, we see the same thing happening from the left as it relates to the “insurrection” of January 6th. Join Rick Green as we discuss the frightening similarities between the 1930’s and 2022.<br>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Quarantine facilities, mandatory vaccinations and tyrannical mandates. That’s what’s happening in Washington State. Today, the Board of Health in Washington is considering … out loud … mandating vaccines for school age children. I’ll be talking about the absurdity of this today with my friend, Pastor Dennis Cummins. ***&lt;a href=&quot;http://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/wa-health-crisis-liberty&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please click here for show notes containing links and important information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Courage and Cowardice: A Contrast and a Command ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The dictionary defines a coward as someone who lacks the courage to do difficult, dangerous, or unpleasant things. In doing this, the coward enslaves himself to fear. On the other hand, God tells His people to “be strong and courageous. This is a command, not a suggestion. You might wonder how could God expect us not to be afraid—and the answer is both simple and profound: it is because He promises to strengthen us and be with us. It’s His strength that helps us not to be afraid, not ours, and it’s available to every Believer!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Permanently Polarized: The Need for Unity in America ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Division, separation, and polarization. It’s reaching incredible heights right now. I see it everywhere and the Bible warns us about it. The question is — are we listening? Division weakens us by making us collectively ineffective in facing the complex challenges in life. Division injures us as a nation by undermining our ability to embrace shared values, and separation will kill us by driving more and more people into isolation—on the other side of the great political and spiritual divide. Jesus spoke against this. And so should we. Look for leaders who will unite, not divide. The hour is late—there is work to be done!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[In the Midst of Darkness: Hope with Pastor Phil Hopper]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Karl Marx had a dream—and his “dream” resulted in the deaths of untold numbers of people around the globe. His dream? To implement a fully secularized government and rid the world of the “opioid” of religion. He wanted to see atheism in the seat of government. Secularized nations worship the government, and nowhere is that more clearly seen right now than in the United States. We are giving more and more of our God-given rights to government and as Christians have removed themselves from government, we see the rise of Marxism right along with it. We are living in a post-Christian era. Indeed, we are, in many respects, back to the days of the early church. These are exciting times for committed Christ followers, and today, Phil Hopper joins me to bring much needed clarity and hope. As we see a false church emerging… the real church is growing stronger by the day.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Many people today are talking about Marxism in glowing terms; it’s not hard to find a college student sporting a Che Guevara t-shirt. &nbsp;Very few take Marxism seriously as an idea. That’s a mistake. Marxism is here, and make no mistake—it is playing for keeps. Marxism is a philosophy but when it is lived out—communism is the result. A Marxist is a person who embraces the philosophy of Karl Marx; a Communist is a person who applies Marx’s ideas to the government and the economy.&nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Worry: The “What If” Monster]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Everywhere I look right now, people are full of anxiety and worry—and with good reason. The criminal, illogical and unscientific mask mandates are back, causing people to be unkind to each other. Wonderful men and women are being fired for not wanting to take an injection. Suicide rates are skyrocketing. We are all feeling the weight of sin in our world right now. So many “what ifs”—and yet—in the middle of it all, Jesus said, “Do not worry.” Today we’ll talk a little about how we can focus on now and not let worry steal our peace and our hope. Hang in there, everyone… you are loved.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For years, pastors have been telling their parishioners that they cannot speak about political issues, hiding behind their tax-exempt 501(c)3 status.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Fear. It’s everywhere. The brave men and women who fought for our freedom would not recognize this generation. Fear is our kryptonite. It keeps us in our homes when we’re afraid of what we cannot see and keeps us from speaking truth in the face of lies because we fear the response of men. Though fear has had a crippling effect on the world in the past 15 months, God is still calling His people to the front lines. The question is not “what will the outcome be,” but rather, “what does God want me to do?” Are we willing to obey no matter the cost? **Find more at </strong><a href="http://heidistjohn.com/"><u><strong>HeidiStJohn.com</strong></u></a><strong>**</strong></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For the next few weeks, I’ll be recording from the bus!&nbsp; This morning, Jay and I were feeling like we were at the end of our rope. Can you relate? Are you weary? Feeling overwhelmed? One of the reasons I love the Bible so much is that we can follow the lives of men and women who faced tremendous obstacles and found strength and hope in the Lord. In the middle of all his problems, ‘David strengthened himself with trust in his God’ (v.6b, MSG). This was the turning point in David’s life. Those who, like David, have turned to God in their deepest distress have been repeatedly amazed at the way God faithfully delivers His own.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Biden gives the thumbs up for BLM flags. And an encouraging story from the archives. “Your body is dependent on this drug.” Those are the words I heard from my physician nearly three years ago when I began experiencing seizures as a result of forgetting to take a prescription drug that I had been taking for over 25 years. “Benzodiazepines,” I was told as I sat sobbing in my doctor’s office, “are harder to get off of than heroin.” Millions of people are struggling with anxiety and millions more know how hard it is to break free from them. Today, my friend Melissa joins me as I talk very candidly about my struggle to get off of anxiety medicine and offer hope to anyone who is struggling to do the same thing. There is hope! Listen in an be encouraged.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Biden gives the thumbs up for BLM flags. And an encouraging story from the archives. “Your body is dependent on this drug.” Those are the words I heard from my physician nearly three years ago when I began experiencing seizures as a result of forgetting to take a prescription drug that I had been taking for over 25 years. “Benzodiazepines,” I was told as I sat sobbing in my doctor’s office, “are harder to get off of than heroin.” Millions of people are struggling with anxiety and millions more know how hard it is to break free from them. Today, my friend Melissa joins me as I talk very candidly about my struggle to get off of anxiety medicine and offer hope to anyone who is struggling to do the same thing. There is hope! Listen in an be encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;We are a world in the firm grip of fear right now. And fears, like every other thought, are based on our beliefs. In the midst of unprecedented challenges, God’s people need to do some soul-searching. Do we truly believe our days were numbered before we were even conceived? Do we really believe all things work together for God’s glory? If so, we need to live like we believe it. Fear is not a virtue! Courage, on the other hand, is. &lt;strong&gt;**Find more at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://heidistjohn.com/&quot; rel=&quot;ugc noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HeidiStJohn.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Crisis of Wisdom]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s hard to look at what’s happening in our world right now without feeling a sense of deep frustration and even anger. We see politicians and bureaucrats making nonsensical and damaging decisions. “Woke” corporations are holding their customers hostage with non-scientific mask mandates and making overtly racist decisions, further eroding our relationships and tearing our nation apart. Where is this coming from? It’s not from God—we know that for sure. Let’s start there. Knowledge puffs up. What we need, desperately, is wisdom. <strong>**Find more at </strong><a href="http://heidistjohn.com/" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HeidiStJohn.com</a><strong>**</strong></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Suicide. Depression. Loss. Grief seems to be all around us right now. Are you experiencing suffering? Do you know someone who is? You’re not alone.

The journey following this tragedy provided the vision for Our Hearts Are Home, a faith-based non-profit organization whose purpose is to minister to grieving families, provide encouragement to those who are suffering, and to educate and equip individuals to reach out to those in need.</p>

Today, as we look to the future, God is asking us to look first to Him. To pray. To fast. To believe—and to live like a set apart people.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If you knew that there was a deadly virus at your local school, would you send your child there? If you knew there was fierce fighting happening at the school, would you pack a snack lunch for them and send them on their way? Sadly, many parents are still turning a blind eye to the real pandemic - the spiritual and moral crisis that’s taking our youth in record numbers is happening in the public schools. The battle is real—and our kids should never be on the front lines. My hunch is that you wouldn’t. The time for excuses is over. The schools are no longer safe places for our kids. It’s time to pull them out.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Building A Life-Giving Legacy… Starting Today]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>If there’s one thing 2020 taught us, it’s that nothing is certain—except one thing. We all have a limited time to make a difference. There is a time to be born and a time to die. We all have a “window” of opportunity in which to leave a legacy and make a difference with our lives. Our legacy in death is a function of the choices we make in life. Are you making choices that will strengthen your legacy, or weaken it? Also today: I’ll be answering questions from listeners, including one from a mom whose children are not walking with God. Keep praying! God is still at work.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>“Your situation is hopeless.” That’s what we heard when my nephew was involved in a devastating accident. “The election is over. Fixing it is hopeless.” That’s what the pundits are saying. Guess what, friends? These are exactly the kind of odds God loves to work with. With God, NOTHING is hopeless. Don’t give up as we ring in the new year. There is always hope with God! If God can raise Lazarus from the dead, He can answer any prayer. Listen in and be encouraged! PS: Be sure you stay up tonight to kick 2020 to the curb!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Bailouts, Lockdowns and Vaccines: Where to Focus Your Energy in 2021]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>January’s almost here. There is a storm on the horizon. People are tired. Government is poised to send an apology note of $2,000 to families, plunging us farther in debt and doing nothing to fix the lockdowns. In the midst of it all, though, God is still at work. One of the main ways He works? Through families. Is it any wonder that the family is under attack? It’s because the family that walks in truth is a powerful force for good in this world. This year, focus on yours. Invest in your family. You were born for such a time as this—and so was your family.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Relationships can be tricky—but they’re worth investing in, even when we disagree. The Bible teaches that we should be sharpening each other “as iron sharpens iron.” In this season of the Rona and political unrest, many of us have struggled in our relationships. Here’s the thing: we can have peace in our relationships, even when we don’t agree. Before you walk away from a friendship, consider the cost. Pray. Seek the Lord for wisdom. Real friendship will stand the test of time. So when you find your tribe, treat the friendship as precious, and hang on tight.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Beth Moore and Christian “Nationalism”]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Beth Moore recently tweeted her disdain for Christians who support President Trump, calling them “nationalists” and urging them to stop supporting the President. Christian “nationalism” is a term made up by leftists to further divide our nation. You can love your country and follow Christ with your entire being. There is a shaking happening in the church. Many leaders I once followed have revealed their true nature and lack of discernment in these perilous times. To not support Trump at this time is to not support Israel and to leave the unborn defenseless. It is to open the door wide to sexual sin and our country to foreign invasion. How did we get here as a Church? What does this mean for Christ followers who are finding themselves at odds with “celebrity” Bible teachers? The truth is that we’ve been here for a long time—and we are just starting to see a great divide in the modern Church.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Beth Moore recently tweeted her disdain for Christians who support President Trump, calling them “nationalists” and urging them to stop supporting the President. Christian “nationalism” is a term made up by leftists to further divide our nation. You can love your country and follow Christ with your entire being. There is a shaking happening in the church. Many leaders I once followed have revealed their true nature and lack of discernment in these perilous times. To not support Trump at this time is to not support Israel and to leave the unborn defenseless. It is to open the door wide to sexual sin and our country to foreign invasion. How did we get here as a Church? What does this mean for Christ followers who are finding themselves at odds with “celebrity” Bible teachers? The truth is that we’ve been here for a long time—and we are just starting to see a great divide in the modern Church.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The church in the US is grappling with something it wasn’t ready for: a tyrannical government. We have heard pastors and religious leaders use Romans 13 as an excuse for closing and even for indifference to the suffering of their fellow Americans, as jobs and livelihoods have been lost due to unconstitutional lockdowns and irrational mandates. So what’s a Christian to do? Tune in as Bill Jack and I discuss this very important topic. **Find links and more under PODCASTS at HeidiStJohn.com**</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In 2018, our family was going through a painful time. We were grieving the loss of a friendship while at the same time, struggling to keep what felt like fifteen balls in the air. One by one, the balls began to drop as night after night, I was awakened by thoughts of insecurity and stemming from the pain in my heart. I wanted the Lord to rescue me. Like David, I was weary. I needed God’s help to quiet my mind and spirit, so that I could rest and be restored. **Find links and more under PODCASTS at HeidiStJohn.com**</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is a very confusing time to shepherd children. Every day, I interact with parents who are struggling to navigate the turbulent waters of a culture in spiritual crisis. Five minutes on Facebook and you’re likely to see articles whose primary aim is to sow seeds of confusion and lies on everything from the dignity of human life to the basic truth of male and female.

			<title><![CDATA[The Woman Who Saved Thanksgiving ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In Thank You, Sarah: The Woman Who Saved Thanksgiving by Laurie Halse Anderson, we see a glimpse of Sarah Hale’s spirit. She wrote persistently to officials in many levels of government promoting the observance of Thanksgiving as a unified national holiday. Not a woman to take “No” for an answer, Sarah kept on writing. For four decades and five Presidencies, Sarah wrote. She believed that observing Thanksgiving was a way that we, as a nation, could be unified. In October, 1863, President Lincoln, perhaps in response to an editorial Hale had published in the magazine she edited, read a Thanksgiving proclamation to the American people. We are still blessed by it today. **Find links and more under PODCASTS at HeidiStJohn.com**</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever had a moment where you wondered if there was something else—something “more important” that you could be doing instead of shepherding and raising children? If so, you’re not alone. The culture today has devalued motherhood in more ways than one. Today I’ll be encouraging you to love your family well in this season. Yes, it’s a hard season for many reasons—but God is calling us back to Himself, and to our families. Listen in and be encouraged. **Find links and more under PODCASTS at HeidiStJohn.com**</p>

In response to this, Candace Owens said, “There is no society that can survive without strong men. The East knows this. In the west, the steady feminization of our men at the same time that Marxism is being taught to our children is not a coincidence. It is an outright attack.” I agree with her.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If we are going to be victorious in the battle between good and evil, we need to know our adversary. Satan’s name reveals much about his character. The title Satan is used fifty-two times in the Bible. It literally means “the adversary” or “the one who opposes.” He is also called the devil, a word that is used more than thirty times in the Bible and means “slanderer” or “accuser.” Regardless of what name he is called, the point is clear: we have a real enemy who wants to take us down. &nbsp;***If you liked today's podcast, you'll love Prayers for the Battlefield!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>As a mother, I like to think of myself as a bit of an arborist. Arborists are basically tree doctors. I’m basically a kid doctor. Right? Anyway. Arborists are awesome. They’ll come in and inspect your tree, let you know if it needs to be pruned, and suggest things that will help you keep your trees healthy. Healthy trees need pruning—just like children. Notice a bad attitude? It’s time for some loving pruning! Watch for any sign of infection. Make sure they get the right amount of sun. Healthy trees need good soil. So do healthy children. The “soil” a healthy child needs is the rich soil of the Bible. Water daily with prayer and then watch for good fruit. It may take time, but keep at it! **Find links and more at HeidiStJohn.com***</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Noble Alexander was born on February 12, 1934 to Cristobal and Beryl Alexander in San German Oriente, Cuba. He served as an assistant pastor in Cuba from 1959-1962. On March 20, 1962, after preaching a sermon on the origin of sin, he was ambushed and taken to prison where he was tried and convicted of conspiracy to assassinate Fidel Castro, the Communist leader of Cuba. At issue was his sermon, which security forces interpreted to be a veiled reference to Castro’s regime. Noble served over 22 years in prison where he endured hard labor, starvation and lengthy time in solitary confinement. Listen in today as I answer questions from listeners and encourage you to hang in there. For the Believer, JOY is always coming. &nbsp;Don’t give up! ***Find Links and More at HeidiStJohn.com***</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The story of Jesus’ encounter with a rich man offers us an incredible insight into the heart of human beings. When the disciples how the rich man could not leave his riches to follow Jesus, they rightly thought of their own inward struggles. They were absolutely right to ask Jesus who in the world can be saved, in light of their own sin and selfishness. Jesus answered by famously saying, “Humanly speaking, it is impossible. But not with God. Everything is possible with God!” &nbsp;Don’t forget to catch the debates tonight! ***Find links and more at HeidiStJohn.com***</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Do you remember the very first time you help your child in your arms? Do you remember the weight of responsibility and the incredible love that you felt? Of course you do. I remember feeling overwhelmed at the thought that the hospital staff would let me take home a brand new, 9 pound human being. I mean, let’s be honest… I didn’t know what I was doing! Truly, I was just making it up as I went along. Come to think of it, I’m still doing that in many respects. Most of my seven children are grown now. They are getting married and having children of their own… and I find I am navigating yet another season of motherhood that I will confess to feeling unprepared for. Motherhood is humbling in every stage and in every season. The challenge I am facing now is how to let my children leave. It is both heartbreaking and exhilarating, and I find I am leaning even into the Lord. ***Find links and more at HeidiStJohn.com***</p>

My hunch is that you will never forget it either… his slogan is still with us today. “Hope and change.” It worked, of course. After all, who doesn’t want hope and change? We are a people in dire need of hope! &nbsp;Here’s the thing though, mom: we need to tell our children the truth about hope. Hope isn’t something that we manufacture. It isn’t something we can get from a politician or even a pastor. We don’t have hope because of a policy or a medical procedure.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>19 years ago today, our nation was attacked in one of the worst terrorist attacks in history. Today, we’re being attacked from within. Across the United States right now, police officers are being vilified and maligned as Marxists work to defund the police and promote lawlessness. Today, I sit down with Janel Ralat, wife of a police officer in Las Vegas to discuss what it’s like for the families of our brave men and women on the front lines and how we can support them in practical ways. ***For links mentioned in the podcast and more, please visit HeidiStJohn.com***</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Casting Out Fear ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>There is so much fear being put on our children right now. We can never forget that fear is a spirit—and God says that "perfect love casts out fear." As parents, we have an incredible opportunity to teach our children how to thrive in times of anxiety and fear—always remembering that we can’t give what we don’t have. Since we can never know what’s around the corner, we must lean daily into the One who does. We need to be ready to give an answer for the hope that we have in Christ—starting with our children. Listen in as I talk about how the term 'rona' started in our home. ***Find links and more at HeidiStJohn.com***</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>My friend and assistant Melissa Crabtree decided to get #offthebench a few weeks ago when a mask mandate and other restrictions were proposed in her city by the city council. Today we're finishing the story of what it has looked like to stand up and rally others to fight for liberty, even with no experience. She's learning along the way, the Lord is bringing others to help, and it's working. The mandate has been voted down twice now in Enid, Oklahoma! Ordinary people are the ones who need to stand up, and Melissa is sharing what she's learned, how Christians can overcome some typical hangups that keep them sitting on the sidelines, why it matters so much. There is a place for everyone to speak up.&nbsp;***Visit HeidiStJohn.com for links and resources mentioned in podcast!***</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>My friend Phil Hopper is a pastor and joining me live in the studio as we talk about corporate gathering with a body of believers, and how we do that even if our city tells us we can't. How do we obey our governing authorities when what they are governing is unbiblical or unconstitutional? The Lord has given us an opportunity to stand, and Phil will share how he has done that with his church in his community. We don't have to sit back and stand down. Listen in!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Birth Story Part 2: Practical Tips for the Dads]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday we heard from my daughter and her husband as they shared their birth story and the challenges that came with it.&nbsp;Today we’re finishing the&nbsp;“living room” conversation about the birth of their&nbsp;baby&nbsp;girl, and&nbsp;Ryan has practical tips for the dads from his own experience—even the third time around. This is a raw, real look inside our tight-knit family… and I think it will bless and encourage you.<br>
Family and a caring community is so important&nbsp;during pregnancy and the postpartum. I’ll be honest: you guys, the first week of Junie’s birth was hard. We all know&nbsp;the weeks around having a baby are expected to be&nbsp;challenging, but adding the stress of this COVID situation is certainly not helping things. Savannah struggled with severe postpartum anxiety—and the Lord helped us through in some pretty amazing ways.<br>
Many of us know someone who’s pregnant right now (you might even be pregnant yourself!) and I think you’ll be encouraged to hear Savannah and&nbsp; Ryan share their story—unfiltered—about what they learned and what they did that helped.&nbsp;</p>

This podcast is brought to you by our friends at <a href="http://faithfulcounseling.com/Heidi">Faithful Counseling</a>.<br>
Hey, everybody. How are you doing? How are you guys doing? This is Heidi St. John. Welcome to the podcast. Today is Wednesday, May 6th. This is episode number 920. And today we’re going to get a little bit real about what’s going on around you and what it means to invite the Lord into every aspect of our lives. Stick around, I think you’re going to be encouraged.<br>
So, I hope you guys are doing good. I feel like the weeks are going by kind of slow right now, like we’re just sort of hanging on for dear life and trying to just follow the Lord in the moment, and follow Him. I know you guys are doing the same thing. This has been a rough season for us for obvious reasons, a rough season for lots of you, and I am particularly grateful for the sponsoring businesses here at the podcast which really are kind of our bread and butter right now. We couldn’t produce the show without them...&nbsp;</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;In case you haven’t noticed, I’m struggling in this. God’s desire is that our&amp;nbsp;hearts would be refreshed and encouraged right now, even though on some days that seems impossible. We know that God is a god of provision. He is Jehovah Jireh, Our Provider. He is Jehovah Rapha, Our Healer. El Roi, The God Who Sees. We serve an amazing god and He has not changed during COVID 19. &amp;nbsp; Join me today, and&amp;nbsp;let’s be reminded where we need to set our eyes. &lt;a href=&quot;http://faithfulcounseling.com/heidi&quot;&gt;Faithful Counseling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Mothers are many things. We are nurturers, chauffeurs, cooks, short-order cooks and first-aid providers. We are shoulders to cry on, advice-givers, drivers ed teachers, and broken heart menders. But the most important role we play in the lives of our kids is the role of teacher. As a homeschool mom, I learned a lesson very early in my mothering journey. Where students and teachers are concerned, it’s the teacher learns the most. After all, we can’t teach what we don’t understand. David acknowledges His need to be taught by the Lord in Psalm 143:10. That means we need to learn to follow. Are we being led by the Lord?&nbsp; Today’s question is from a wife whose husband is emotionally absent. Your marriage is worth fighting for!&nbsp;</p>

Herein lies the “discipline” of prayer.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>God has extended safety and belonging to us, and He calls us to do the same to others. It would work well for the enemy to trick people into believing that the practice of hospitality requires a large budget, large amounts of time, or a large home. All of those are lies. Your house doesn’t have to be perfect and your budget doesn’t either. Being hospitable is important to God, and He speaks of it in the Word as one clear way we love others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Freedom From Anger | MomStrong Internationa Week 2/4]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Bible has a lot to say about strong emotions and our responses. Let’s dig in and see what’s there about anger and patience—since one seems to be tied to a lack of the other. Thankfully, God has much more than just commands for us to follow; the gospel also gives us resources for endurance and faithfulness while we’re in the trenches of motherhood and the busy grind of everyday life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>There is a huge difference between “fruit of the Spirit” that makes us like Christ, and “fruit” that comes as a result of our actions. When we read the Bible, we need to read contextually. What does this mean? Reading the Bible in context means we need to gain a full awareness of the passage or paragraph rather than just pulling out one verse. Let’s jump in to our first week of the MSI study on the fruit of the Spirit!!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Culture is so strong that churches are bending to its will. Are you struggling to shine in the midst of it all? The culture is awash with opinions and issues these days—so what does a Christian do? We are called to be full of grace and truth. We must never sacrifice truth on the altar of misguided mercy. Jesus was grieved at the Pharisees’ unwillingness to understand or even seeks God’s heart with issues such as healing on the Sabbath. Today, we’ll look at the similarities between the story in Mark&nbsp;chapter 3 and the church culture today.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Christian Alternatives to Yoga with Jessica Smith | Part Two]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Is yoga harmless? Is it just another form of exercise, or is the strong spiritual component of yoga something Christians should be wary of? Yoga means "to yoke" or to open oneself up and <em>invite in </em>the spirit of yoga. Yoga sutras are a basically a guidebook for divination, which God expressly prohibits in the Bible. Listen in as Jessica Smith makes a strong case for how the poses alone invite spiritual forces into our lives that have no place in the lives of Christ followers. The Bible says,&nbsp;"You shall have no other God's before Me." Let's talk about alternatives to yoga today!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Christianity and Yoga: Do They Mix? with Jessica Smith | Part One]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Should Christianity mix with yoga? Are yoga poses benign if we do them but don't engage in the spiritual practice behind them? This is the question I'm asking my guest, Jessica Smith, who taught yoga for many years. Jessica has a unique perspective and a solid biblical stance on this modern controversy.&nbsp;Yoga&nbsp;is one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophical traditions, yet many Christians today are practicing yoga with the belief that yoga's deep ties to Hinduism and Buddhism can be avoided. I will confess, I thought the same thing—but not any longer. Jessica challenged me and opened my eyes to the truth about this topic. Listen in. I pray your heart is blessed and encouraged as you strive to know God in a deeper way and bring Him honor in everything you do.&nbsp;Be sure and catch Part 2 as well!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, a viral ad sparked frustration when it took aim at “toxic masculinity.” Today, I’ll address a few questions from listeners about God’s view of male and female and why I believe we need more, not less masculine men in our culture. Ultimately, our struggle is not with our gender. It’s a struggle with sin, and neither sex is immune the the struggle. God has created us differently. Let’s celebrate what He has created!<br>

			<title><![CDATA[The Case for Discipleship with Leslie Nunnery]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Have you ever struggled to understand the &#8220;how&#8221; and &#8220;why&#8221; of discipling your children? Join me today as I talk with my friend, author Leslie Nunnery, about the HOPE that springs from a life devoted to following Jesus. Parents who know Christ have His promises to guide them—and when we pass His truths to our children, God promises to do the rest.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/leslie-nunnery-Headshot-Small.jpeg"></a>Leslie Nunnery, a homeschool mom of 4, is the co-founder of <a href="http://www.teachthemdiligently.net">Teach Them Diligently</a> along with her husband David. God has given her a strong burden to minister to Christian families to help support, encourage and equip them to disciple their children, protect their marriages, and serve God in the ways He has planned for them.<br />
As parents, we’ve been given a powerful promise with clear instructions. God tells us in Deuteronomy to &#8220;teach our children diligently.&#8221; This passage—as well as many others—gives us great insight into how to train our children and how to enjoy the promised blessing that always accompanies the mandates we are given. So, why are we as Christian parents still uncertain? Why do we live in fear? Why are we losing our children in record numbers? And what can we do about it?<br />
<a href="https://amzn.to/2W9Wsxo">Teach Them Diligently: Raising Children of Promise</a> is a solution-focused, easy-to-read guide that is parent-centric and sets out to make the point that Christian discipleship—as commanded in the Great Commission—starts in the home.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[Finding a Balance Between Work and Rest | MSI Week 3/4 ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Ecclesiastes 4:6 says that rest is a better option than labor, yet Galatians 6:9 tells us not to lose heart and grow weary–not to stop working. What’s happening here? We know the Word does not contradict itself, so there must be something important in both passages. When do we labor and when is labor unimportant? God commands us to labor with our hands. Labor is good, yet work for the sake of accolades or profit is a waste. Labor and sacrifice for the Gospel is both modeled and blessed by God.<br>
Jesus modeled labor and rest beautifully for us. This week, we’ll come to understand how God’s priority of salvation directs both our labor and our rest.<br>
Moms, if we’re honest, some of us struggle to find value in having a clean living space for our family. So.much.work. Some of us struggle to see the value in training our kids in the area of chores because it’s often harder to teach them how to clean a toilet (You know, with soap.) than to just clean the thing yourself. It’s more work to train a child to do a chore the right way, and follow through with their work, then it is to just do it yourself while they play happily in the other room, or sleep until noon. When we give in to that, we raise a generation of children who do not know the value or the deep satisfaction of working hard. But then again, we’re modeling balance (or at least we’re supposed to be). Listen in today as I touch&nbsp;on this month’s Bible Study at <a href="http://momstronginternational.com">MomStrong International</a>.<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Walking With God through Suffering]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This month at MomStrong International, we’ve been studying the topic of joy… but what happens when we’re walking through suffering? 1 Peter talks about suffering proportionately more than any other book in the Bible. In the passage we’ve been looking at, he draws on an illustration from Isaiah 43. Today, I&nbsp;will be teaching on the metaphor of the fire—but looking more closely at the “refiners” fire and the promise that comes with it. If you’re struggling to understand a purpose for your pain, listen in and be encouraged!<br>

Merry Christmas friends. This is Heidi St. John, welcome to the Heidi St. John podcast! <br />
Today is Wednesday December 19th. This is episode number 703. <br />
Today we&#8217;re going to be continuing the study at <a href="https://momstronginternational.com/">MomStrong International</a> &#8211; InSearch of JOY. The JOY we are looking for is a deep foundational contentment. Let&#8217;s find out today how to get it! <br />
Stick around, I think you&#8217;re going to be encouraged!  <br />
All right you guys. So I am thrilled we are halfway through the month of December and just the other day we reached 10,000 members over at <a href="https://momstronginternational.com/">MomStrong International</a>! So keep your eyes out on the forums, out on the chat rooms at <a href="https://momstronginternational.com/">MomStrong International</a> &#8211; and we are going to start giving stuff away! <br />
I cannot wait to see what God does in 2019 as we study His Word and continue to dig deeper for the answers that we&#8217;re looking for as we grapple with the questions of the culture right now. <br />
Couple of things I want to let you know before we dig into today&#8217;s study. The first thing is that we have really amazing gift baskets for you at <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/">HeidiStJohn.com</a>. If you search for the <a href="https://heidistjohn.myshopify.com/">Heidi St. John Store</a> you will see that we have necklaces. We have two different styles of arrows (<a href="https://heidistjohn.myshopify.com/collections/becoming-momstrong/products/momstrong-arrow-necklace-large">here</a> and <a href="https://heidistjohn.myshopify.com/collections/becoming-momstrong/products/feather-arrow-pendant">here</a>), and a <a href="https://heidistjohn.myshopify.com/collections/becoming-momstrong/products/momstrong-quiver-necklace">Quiver Necklace</a>, we have a brand new series of shirts in the store right now based out of the Psalms.One of them says <a href="https://heidistjohn.myshopify.com/collections/becoming-momstrong/products/battle-raglan">He trains my hands for battle</a>. <br />
These are great gifts for the women in your life and for the young girls! Their wonderful gifts for your daughters &#8211; to let them know that they are arrows in the hands of their warrior Father, The King of kings, and the Lord of lords. <br />
Also, you can get them in baskets. If you do the gift baskets they come with a limited release candle that has arrows, gold embossed arrows, all around it! So check it out at <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/">HeidiStJohn.com</a> just click on the <a href="https://heidistjohn.myshopify.com/">store</a> and I hope that that will bless you! Also It blesses us &#8211; when you shop from that store it helps us with the ministry here. <br />
Also wanted to let you know that we believe that giving the gift of membership to <a href="https://momstrongi...

&lt;br /&gt;
Merry Christmas friends. This is Heidi St. John, welcome to the Heidi St. John podcast! &lt;br /&gt;
Today is Wednesday December 19th. This is episode number 703. &lt;br /&gt;
Today we&amp;#8217;re going to be continuing the study at &lt;a href=&quot;https://momstronginternational.com/&quot;&gt;MomStrong International&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; InSearch of JOY. The JOY we are looking for is a deep foundational contentment. Let&amp;#8217;s find out today how to get it! &lt;br /&gt;
Stick around, I think you&amp;#8217;re going to be encouraged!  &lt;br /&gt;
All right you guys. So I am thrilled we are halfway through the month of December and just the other day we reached 10,000 members over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://momstronginternational.com/&quot;&gt;MomStrong International&lt;/a&gt;! So keep your eyes out on the forums, out on the chat rooms at &lt;a href=&quot;https://momstronginternational.com/&quot;&gt;MomStrong International&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; and we are going to start giving stuff away! &lt;br /&gt;
I cannot wait to see what God does in 2019 as we study His Word and continue to dig deeper for the answers that we&amp;#8217;re looking for as we grapple with the questions of the culture right now. &lt;br /&gt;
Couple of things I want to let you know before we dig into today&amp;#8217;s study. The first thing is that we have really amazing gift baskets for you at &lt;a href=&quot;http://heidistjohn.com/&quot;&gt;HeidiStJohn.com&lt;/a&gt;. If you search for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://heidistjohn.myshopify.com/&quot;&gt;Heidi St. John Store&lt;/a&gt; you will see that we have necklaces. We have two different styles of arrows (&lt;a href=&quot;https://heidistjohn.myshopify.com/collections/becoming-momstrong/products/momstrong-arrow-necklace-large&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://heidistjohn.myshopify.com/collections/becoming-momstrong/products/feather-arrow-pendant&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://heidistjohn.myshopify.com/collections/becoming-momstrong/products/momstrong-quiver-necklace&quot;&gt;Quiver Necklace&lt;/a&gt;, we have a brand new series of shirts in the store right now based out of the Psalms.One of them says &lt;a href=&quot;https://heidistjohn.myshopify.com/collections/becoming-momstrong/products/battle-raglan&quot;&gt;He trains my hands for battle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
These are great gifts for the women in your life and for the young girls! Their wonderful gifts for your daughters &amp;#8211; to let them know that they are arrows in the hands of their warrior Father, The King of kings, and the Lord of lords. &lt;br /&gt;
Also, you can get them in baskets. If you do the gift baskets they come with a limited release candle that has arrows, gold embossed arrows, all around it! So check it out at &lt;a href=&quot;http://heidistjohn.com/&quot;&gt;HeidiStJohn.com&lt;/a&gt; just click on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://heidistjohn.myshopify.com/&quot;&gt;store&lt;/a&gt; and I hope that that will bless you! Also It blesses us &amp;#8211; when you shop from that store it helps us with the ministry here. &lt;br /&gt;

Because of the depth of the undercurrent of joy in the life of a Christian, no matter what is happening on the surface, the undercurrent still moves with strength and stability when it is rooted in Christ.

			<description><![CDATA[Today I&#8217;m answering several questions about how we parent small children.  From character building (and my favorite parenting books) to the way we handle gifts at Christmas, it all matters to the Lord!<br />
<a href="http://momstronginternational.com"></a><br />
<a href="https://amzn.to/2PkctMQ">Parenting Isn&#8217;t for Cowards: The &#8216;You Can Do It&#8217; Guide for Hassled Parents</a> by James Dobson <br />
Does your heart skip a beat when you think of all that could go wrong in the parenting years ahead? Anxiety is normal, but your worst fears don’t have to become reality. Speaking both as a therapist and a father―and drawing on a landmark study of thirty-five thousand parents―Dr. James Dobson helps you . . .<br />
<br />
* prevent child-rearing troubles before they happen<br />
* banish your guilt about hard-to-raise children<br />
* protect your sanity during a child’s adolescence<br />
* restore your energy when you’re facing burnout<br />
* enhance your relationships with your kids<br />
<br />
<a title="5 Love Languages" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802403476/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802403476&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thbumo0c-20&amp;linkId=LYE4BD76XEDRWTE5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 5 Love Languages of Children</a> by Gary Chapman<br />
Does your child speak a different language? Sometimes they wager for your attention, and other times they ignore you completely. Sometimes they are filled with gratitude and affection, and other times they seem totally indifferent. Attitude. Behavior. Development. Everything depends on the love relationship between you and your child. When children feel loved, they do their best. But how can you make sure your child feels loved?<br />
<a title="Strong Fathers" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345499395/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0345499395&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thbumo0c-20&amp;linkId=7EVR4XILYT7EHWKV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strong Fathers, Strong Daughters: 10 Secrets Every Father Should Know</a> by Dr. Meg Meeker<br />
In today’s increasingly complicated world, it’s often difficult for parents to connect with their daughters–and especially so for fathers. In this unique and invaluable guide, Dr. Meg Meeker, a pediatrician with more than twenty years’ experience counseling girls, reveals that a young woman’s relationship with her father is far more important than we’ve ever realized. To become a strong, confident woman, a daughter needs her father’s attention, protection, courage, and wisdom. Dr. Meeker shares the ten secrets every father needs to know in order to strengthen or rebuild bonds with his daughter and shape her life–and his own–for the better.<br />
<a title="Parenting by the Book" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476718717/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1476718717&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thbumo0c-20&amp;linkId=36DWJXSA6XFH2RT7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parenting by The Book: Biblical Wisdom for Raising Your Child</a> by John Rosemond<br />
Picture respectful, responsible, obedient children who entertain themselves without television or video games, do their own homework, and have impeccable manners. A pie-in-the-sky fantasy? Not so, says family psychologist and bestselling author John Rosemond.<br />
In the 1960s, American parents stopped listening to their elders when it came to child rearing and began listening instead to professional experts. Since then, raising children has become fraught with anxiety, stress, and frustration. The solution, says John, lies in raising children according to biblical principles, the same principles that guided parents successfully for hundreds of years. They worked then, and they still work now!<br />

Does your heart skip a beat when you think of all that could go wrong in the parenting years ahead? Anxiety is normal, but your worst fears don’t have to become reality. Speaking both as a therapist and a father―and drawing on a landmark study of thirty-five thousand parents―Dr. James Dobson helps you . . .&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* prevent child-rearing troubles before they happen&lt;br /&gt;
* banish your guilt about hard-to-raise children&lt;br /&gt;
* protect your sanity during a child’s adolescence&lt;br /&gt;
* restore your energy when you’re facing burnout&lt;br /&gt;
* enhance your relationships with your kids&lt;br /&gt;

Does your child speak a different language? Sometimes they wager for your attention, and other times they ignore you completely. Sometimes they are filled with gratitude and affection, and other times they seem totally indifferent. Attitude. Behavior. Development. Everything depends on the love relationship between you and your child. When children feel loved, they do their best. But how can you make sure your child feels loved?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a title=&quot;Strong Fathers&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345499395/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0345499395&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=thbumo0c-20&amp;amp;linkId=7EVR4XILYT7EHWKV&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Strong Fathers, Strong Daughters: 10 Secrets Every Father Should Know&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. Meg Meeker&lt;br /&gt;
In today’s increasingly complicated world, it’s often difficult for parents to connect with their daughters–and especially so for fathers. In this unique and invaluable guide, Dr. Meg Meeker, a pediatrician with more than twenty years’ experience counseling girls, reveals that a young woman’s relationship with her father is far more important than we’ve ever realized. To become a strong, confident woman, a daughter needs her father’s attention, protection, courage, and wisdom. Dr. Meeker shares the ten secrets every father needs to know in order to strengthen or rebuild bonds with his daughter and shape her life–and his own–for the better.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a title=&quot;Parenting by the Book&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476718717/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1476718717&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=thbumo0c-20&amp;amp;linkId=36DWJXSA6XFH2RT7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Parenting by The Book: Biblical Wisdom for Raising Your Child&lt;/a&gt; by John Rosemond&lt;br /&gt;
Picture respectful, responsible, obedient children who entertain themselves without television or video games, do their own homework, and have impeccable manners. A pie-in-the-sky fantasy? Not so, says family psychologist and bestselling author John Rosemond.&lt;br /&gt;
In the 1960s, American parents stopped listening to their elders when it came to child rearing and began listening instead to professional experts. Since then, raising children has become fraught with anxiety, stress, and frustration. The solution, says John, lies in raising children according to biblical principles, the same principles that guided parents successfully for hundreds of years. They worked then, and they still work now!&lt;br /&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Parenting in the Internet Age, with Kirk Cameron ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Like many of you, I came to &#8220;know&#8221; Kirk Cameron in the 80&#8217;s, watching the hit sitcom &#8220;Growing Pains&#8221; — but these days, Kirk is using his influence to strengthen families who are raising their kids in a digital age.<br />
In a social media-centered world, the smart phone has become a cultural rite of passage for kids. But is that rite all wrong?  How can this generation of parents blaze a new trail to equip their kids to thrive in an ever-changing digital environment while steering clear of the dangers that lurk nearby? Join in the conversation and be encouraged as Kirk Cameron and I discuss this very important topic.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://connectmovie.com/buy">‘Kirk Cameron: CONNECT’ Focuses on Strengthening Families in the Digital Age</a><br />
Now available on Digital, On Demand and DVD<br /><br />
Actor &amp; Father of Six Offers Real Help for Parenting Kids in a Social Media World<br /><br />
Nashville, TN – June 5, 2018 – Kirk Cameron, a passionate advocate of marriages and families, has created what may be his most exciting and critical project to date, one that aims to enlighten and encourage parents in today’s digitally driven environment.<br /><br />
In a social media-centered world, the smart phone has become a cultural rite of passage for kids. But is that rite all wrong?<br />
How can this generation of parents blaze a new trail to equip their kids to thrive in an ever-changing digital environment while steering clear of the dangers that lurk nearby?<br /><br />
With six teenagers, Cameron and his wife Chelsea, fully understand this dilemma. So, he went to the experts, and what he learned will enlighten, challenge and equip parents.<br /><br />
In an online world that creates an illusion of reality and “friends” through social media, apps and “followers,” Kirk Cameron: CONNECT pulls back the curtain to the benefits, dangers and boundaries that every parent, teacher, pastor or youth leader should consider while monitoring and utilizing technology in our children’s lives. As Cameron reminds parents, “The heart of the battle is really the battle of the heart.”<br />
Notable guests in this compelling documentary include Dr. Ian Armstrong (Neurosurgeon),<br /><br />
Kathy Koch, Ph.D. (founder of Celebrate Kids, Inc.), Tim Woda (founder of uKnowKids), Pastor Ken Graves (Calvary Chapel, Bangor, Maine), and Mark Gregston (founder of Heartlight). Also featured are parents and young adults who share their personal stories regarding the life-changing impact of technology in their own lives.<br />
“God-fearing parents can find confidence and guidance when it comes to the challenges of parenting in our technology-driven world, knowing that God has fully equipped us for the sacred calling as a parent,” said Cameron. “We have resources to prepare our children as they learn their purpose and identity, and responsibly use technology to understand family, friends, God and the world around them.”<br />
Kirk Cameron: CONNECT, which premiered as a limited theatrical event this past spring, is now available on DVD from CamFam Studios and Provident Films<br />
<br />
<a href="http://kirkcameron.com/">Kirk Cameron</a> is best known for his memorable role of “Mike Seaver”, a cultural icon of the<br /><br />
80’s, with his mullet hairstyle, cool glasses, and wisecracking comebacks on ABC&#8217;s “Growing Pains.”  Since then, he’s appeared in numerous television and movie productions, including the Left<br /><br />
Behind series, Monumental, and Fireproof—the marriage-centered film that became the #1 grossing inspirational film of the year.<br /><br />
He’s been featured on Good Morning America, The Today Show, Dr. Oz, Nightline, Fox News, and CNN and currently travels the country speaking on his brand new marriage and parenting tour, Living Room Reset that offers a night of worship, teaching, and heartfelt conversation about what matters most to husbands, wives, and parents.<br />

<br />

			<description><![CDATA[This month at MomStrong International, we are studying the book of Job as we learn how to find blessing on the battlefield. God allowed suffering into Job&#8217;s life, and then, rather than answer Job&#8217;s unanswerable questions, He showed him a glimpse of who HE is. Are you abiding today in the sovereignty and goodness of God? Listen in and find out how you can rest in the midst of struggle in part two of this series.<br />

			<description><![CDATA[Have you ever struggled to rest in the Lord? Jesus said to take His yoke, because it was &#8220;easy and light,&#8221; and yet, most of us don&#8217;t know what that looks like.  Today, Heidi begins part one of a two-part series on &#8220;abiding.&#8221; If you&#8217;re in need of peace as we enter into this busy time of year, listen in and be encouraged!<br />
More from The Busy Mom:<br />
<a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog//?p=13513" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hope in Our Heartache</a> &#8211; God&#8217;s main concern isn&#8217;t our happiness. Happiness is temporary, fleeting, dependent on the circumstances or the moment. No, He&#8217;s concerned with our holiness. Because when we are holy, we ascribe glory to Him which is the entire reason we were created.  You see, God sees the big picture in our lives, and He can use anything to make us more like Him. Failure, hunger, depression, heartache, wayward children&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog//?p=9819" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prompted by Love, Inspired by Hope</a> &#8211; The endurance needed for the days of mothering is inspired by hope.  The hope of good things to come if we don&#8217;t give up.  The hope that as we train our children, they will walk in the truth. It&#8217;s truly a hope that is prompted by love.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[Off The Bench with Guest, Ruth Simons ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In a biblically illiterate culture, how can we disciple our children daily? Join Heidi and her friend, Ruth Simons (Author of Gracelaced) for an honest conversation about Prayers for the Battlefield and how we can encourage our children to know and apply God&#8217;s Word in their everyday lives.<br />
Ruth Chou Simons is an artist, writer, entrepreneur, and speaker. She is the creator of the GraceLaced online art shoppe, blog, and the popular Instagram community where she shares scriptural truths daily through honest words and her hand-painted artwork. Ruth and her husband, Troy, live in New Mexico and are grateful parents to six sons—their greatest adventure.<br /><br />
Find more of Ruth’s heart and art at <a href="http://Gracelaced.com">GraceLaced.com</a> and @gracelaced on Instagram,<br /><br />
Facebook, and Twitter.<br />
Ruth&#8217;s new book <a href="http://amzn.to/2ws0Kqy">Gracelaced</a>  is about more than pretty florals and fanciful brushwork—it&#8217;s about flourishing. With carefully crafted intention, this beautiful volume of 32 seasonal devotions from artist and author Ruth Chou Simons encourages readers in any circumstance to become deeply rooted in God&#8217;s faithful promises.<br />

What does it take to stand strong in the gap as we get off the bench for future generations? Answer? Obey the call of God on your life!<br />

			<title><![CDATA[From Victim to Victory, with Chloe Howard ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Chloe Howard was born with a severe club foot. Listen in as she shares the inspiring true story from her new book, &#8220;Stand Beautiful.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://beautiful.chloehoward.com/">Chloe Howard</a>  was born with a severe foot deformity.  She has had numerous operations and faced daunting challenges but has always met each hurdle with emotional strength and grace.   In 2014, Chloe was a victim of assault and bullying at her high school. Six months later, she had the courage to begin telling her story. She met Bono who spoke powerful words about fighting injustice.  This became a turning point for Chloe and would mark a recovery story that builds in strength with each re-telling.<br />
<a href="https://amzn.to/2QDUB08">Stand Beautiful: A story of brokenness, beauty and embracing it all</a>: In Stand Beautiful, international speaker and TEDx presenter Chloe Howard shares her story of overcoming injustice, battling self-doubt, and rising up to speak out, fueled by a powerful encounter with Bono from the band U2. Chloe’s story shows that even through brokenness and shame, we can venture toward hope, accept our unique selves, and share in our human experiences. Chloe boldly addresses the unlikely hero in each of us. Readers will be inspired to be brave, to speak up against injustice, and redefine beauty as more than what the eye can see. Chloe shares how faith enabled her to endure physical and emotional pain, spurring readers to delve into authenticity and stand beautiful.<br />
<a href="https://amzn.to/2ytpXiM">Stand Beautiful, picture book</a>: With playful text and adorable illustrations by Deborah Melmon, this picture book asks the question: Will YOU stand beautiful too?<br />

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Many Christians have joined the tolerance movement, wanting to be known for their acceptance of others’ opinions and lifestyles in a misguided attempt to share the gospel. Why is this misguided? Because the life of Jesus stands in stark opposition to this brave new belief system.<br>
A thoughtful study of the Bible will quickly reveal that tolerance as it is thought of today was never seen as a virtue.&nbsp;Why? Let’s talk about it.&nbsp;<br>

			<title><![CDATA[Born on a Battlefield | What is Truth? Week 5 ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Over 2000 years ago Pontius Pilate spoke to Jesus and asked Him, “What is the truth?” What Pilate didn’t know is that he was talking to The Truth: God in the flesh, the One through whom the world was created. Pilate washed his hands of Jesus’ death and sadly, never came to know The Truth. Today, we are fortunate to be able to know The Truth! And our job is to teach that to our children. This is the way of the Savior: to live and walk in truth. As you study God’s word and prayerfully seek truth, you will *always* find it. Do not grow weary, parents. Seek hard after truth and you will find it!<br>

			<description><![CDATA[Today, I am joined by my effervescent friend, Gwen Smith, of the Graceology podcast. Listen in as we share encouragement from the Bible and practical tips for how you can stay strong when life knocks you to your knees.  Get off the bench! God is at your side!<br />
<br />
Gwen Smith is a popular conference speaker, author, worship leader, podcaster and volleyball enthusiast who lives in sunny North Carolina and has been married to her hunky college honey, Brad, for 25 years. They are tired parents to three tall, competitive-sport-playing young people who keep them on their toes and on their knees. Her online friends meet at <a href="http://www.gwensmith.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.gwensmith.net/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1537594316995000&amp;usg=AFQjCNELfkcSxl6ngAhwJ42nTpHDFQ070Q">GwenSmith.net</a> where she helps women know and trust God more.

Gwen speaks, leads worship, and eats potato chips at women’s events everywhere, and she is a co-founder of the conference and devotional ministry <a href="http://www.girlfriendsingod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.girlfriendsingod.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1537594316995000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEFdUafYe2wJ8ljKLcgH9ZYyW5Paw">Girlfriends in God</a>. <br />

If we want to have a FAITH BEYOND our FEELINGS, FEARs, and FAILURES we need to stand firm when our emotions threaten to overwhelm us and courageously believe God for big things. We need to be women who KNEEEL.<br />
I came up with this simple ACRONYM to help us remember how to stand firm in faith when our knees knock:<br />
         K – Know Him<br />
         N – Notify: My Heart, My Enemy &amp; My Girlfriends<br />
         E – Express the Mess<br />
         E – Exchange My Will For God’s Will<br />
         E – Expand My Heart In Worship<br />
         L – Learn the Word<br />

			<description><![CDATA[Ever wonder what one person getting off the bench can accomplish for the Kingdom? Join Heidi today for an inspiring story of love and compassion in action!<br />
<a href="http://flashlove.org/">Flash Love</a> is a simple message through actions by the people who are ready to make a difference in this broken world. We work with high school age youth teaching them leadership by example as we identify needs in our community. We also work with boys referred to us by teachers, counselors and social workers by helping them understand their roles in life as men. Both of our target demographics help us serve struggling families and seniors that are evicted or unable to clean up their yards, have food insufficiency or need help moving. We respond as often as we can using each opportunity to comprehend the struggles and display compassion to the least of those around us.<br />

			<description><![CDATA[There is a version of &#8220;Christianity&#8221; that is troubling on many levels, and we must be aware and learn to measure it against the Word of God. Jesus did not die so that we can wallow in our sin. He died so that we can be reconciled to the Lord! Transformation happens in the deep as we pursue Jesus. If we spend all of our time in the shallows, we won&#8217;t grow. Know your word, Sister, and don&#8217;t miss today&#8217;s podcast!<br />

			<title><![CDATA[How Can We Support Public School Teachers?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[I talk a lot about homeschooling on my podcast, because it&#8217;s what we do, but there are millions of children in public school each day being loved by their hard-working teachers. Today I have one of my closest friends as our special guest. Carol Bates is my daughter&#8217;s mother-in-law, and is joining us to share how we can pray for and support teachers each day as they minister to all of our children, even if you don&#8217;t have children in the public school system.<br /><br />

See You at the Pole™ is simply a prayer rally where students meet at the school flagpole before school to lift up their friends, families, teachers, school, and nation to God. See You at the Pole™ is a student-initiated, student-organized, and student-led event.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[The Best Accident that Ever Happened, with Yvette Hampton ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[A listener is asking about my accidental homeschooling status, and it turns out, I&#8217;m not the only one &#8217;round these parts! Yvette Hampton is joining me today and we&#8217;re talking about why we decided to homeschool and SchoolHouse Rocked, a documentary you won&#8217;t want to miss!<br /><br />
Yvette Hampton has been married to her awesome husband, Garritt, for 23 years and is beyond blessed to be mom to her two sweet girls. She is the producer and host of the upcoming documentary, <a href="https://youtu.be/rLvNuWAY4Gc">Schoolhouse Rocked: The Homeschool Revolution</a>.<br />
<br />
In the fall of 2016, she and her family sold their home and most of their possessions, loaded up in an RV, and began traveling the country to film Schoolhouse Rocked. They have a passion for the homeschool community and are humbled and honored that the Lord has called them to tell the story of the millions of families who have been impacted by the homeschool revolution.<br />
The movie is intended to dispel the many misconceptions and negative stereotypes of homeschooling as well as to encourage and equip parents to take charge of their child’s heart and education. They plan to release Schoolhouse Rocked in theaters in the summer of 2019!<br />

			<title><![CDATA[The Effects of Feminism on the Hearts of our Boys and Men]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today, I am answering a question from a listener who is frustrated by the attempts to emasculate men in our culture today, especially since she is trying to raise her boys to love and protect women. The Bible says we have been created differently as male and female. One is not better than the other—but we have unique strengths and weaknesses. Let&#8217;s embrace them!<br />

			<title><![CDATA[The Slow Fade of Sexual Sin in the Church]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[The cultural agenda toward sexual sin is grievous and doesn&#8217;t seem to be skipping any area of our world today. It&#8217;s God&#8217;s heart for you that you would stand and be an ambassador for Jesus, no matter the cultural climate in which you find yourself. His heart is that you would love people like He did. He is love, but He is also holy and just. What does that mean for us in how we relate to those who claim that sexual sin isn&#8217;t really sin after all?<br />

			<title><![CDATA[Does the Bible Answer Questions About Sexuality? with Dr Georgia Purdom ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Every week, I receive heart-breaking emails and messages via social media from parents who are struggling to navigate their way through a confusing and deceitful new narrative regarding human sexuality. As Christians, God calls us to know His Word—and like all things related to His creation, God is not silent on the issue of human sexuality. Today, I am thrilled to introduce you to Dr. Georgia Purdom. We&#8217;ll be talking for a few minutes about how we can be better equipped to answer the questions that a generation in spiritual crisis is asking about sex. Join me for an encouraging and informative podcast!<br />
Dr. Georgia Purdom earned her PhD in molecular genetics from The Ohio State University.  After teaching as a college biology professor for 6 years, she joined Answers in Genesis in 2006 where she serves as the Ministry Content Administrator in addition to being a speaker, writer, and researcher. She also directs AiG’s annual women’s conference, Answers for Women, bringing relevant apologetics teaching to women. Dr. Purdom and her husband Chris have been married for 21 years and have a 14 year old daughter Elizabeth. Georgia enjoys homeschooling her daughter and teaching online for Liberty University. Find Dr. Purdom on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GeorgiaPurdom">Facebook here</a>.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[It’s Not About You | Is that Really in the Bible? Week 5 ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today, we&#8217;re continuing our study &#8220;Is that Really in the Bible&#8221; from MomStrong International! Have you ever thought of yourself as the center of God&#8217;s story? In a post-modern Church, that is often the case. We often have a tendency to insert ourselves into the center of biblical stories–we become the hero instead of seeing Jesus as the true hero or we reduce narratives down to a set of moral principles to apply so we can have a better life. This kind of man-centered reading and preaching can take glory away from God and distort the true nature of the Bible. Bottom line? The Bible is about God. It&#8217;s HIStory &#8211; and it points us to Jesus.<br />
<br />
Scriptures<br />
Luke 24:27<br /><br />
Isaiah 53:7-8<br />

			<title><![CDATA[Why Do We Homeschool? ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[People often ask me why my husband and I decided to homeschool our seven children. Truthfully, we never planned on homeschooling—but we have come to believe that it is the best educational option out there today for many reasons: socialization, educational opportunities, freedom&#8230; just for starters. If you&#8217;re a parent who is sitting on the fence about homeschooling or if you&#8217;re a seasoned homeschooler who has lost your vision for education, tune in today! Heidi has a big hug for you and a reminder that what you&#8217;re doing is worth it.<br />
<a href="http://momstronginternational.com"></a><br /><br />
Event with Andrew Pudewa &#8212;&gt; More info <a href="https://www.fphrc.org/resource-center-calendar/2018/8/30/learn-all-about-writing-with-andrew-pudewa">here</a>!<br />

<a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog//?p=22201" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 Reasons NOT to Homeschool, and Why We Decided to Give it a Try</a> &#8211; There&#8217;s much more on my mind than whether or not parents should homeschool their kids. I think there are some very compelling reasons for Jesus followers to NOT take on the responsibility and commitment of homeschooling.<br />
<a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog//?p=810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homeschooling Held Hostage</a> &#8211; &#8220;We&#8217;ve gone from a few brave moms who, without access to mainstream &#8220;curriculum&#8221;, managed to give their children an excellent education—but we&#8217;ve forgotten what made it excellent. It was excellent because these moms had a vision for homeschooling—they weren&#8217;t trying to re-create school at home. They were simply being obedient to the One who had called them to be different. They knew that if He had called them, He would equip them.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog//?p=14089" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is the Goal of Education?</a> &#8211; &#8220;It is a reminder that it matters who teaches your children. You see, discipleship is the goal of education. Christian homeschooling should not only be about teaching the ABC’s. Yes, academics are an essential component in homeschooling, but the foundation and power of homeschooling is found in the quiet resolve of two parents who are committed to teach their children to be fully devoted, mature followers of Jesus Christ.&#8221;<br />

			<description><![CDATA[Many of us are struggling with the hard places of life right now. Unexpected loss, tragedy, prodigal children, a culture that cries out for hope. Why DO bad things happen—and where is God in the middle of it all?  It&#8217;s difficult when we think God made a bad decision, or we don&#8217;t understand His plans. Join Heidi today as she addresses this topic and reads a little from her newest book, &#8220;Prayers for the Battlefield.&#8221; We cannot always understand why things happen — but we can know that God&#8217;s heart toward His children is good, and that He never leaves or forsakes His own.<br />

			<description><![CDATA[I get letters and emails daily from parents who are struggling to shield their children from the onslaught of the transgender movement. It&#8217;s in our libraries, in &#8220;children&#8217;s&#8221; books, in television shows. Today, I am answering a question from a mom who is struggling to speak the truth and wonders where that boldness can be found. Spoiler alert: God will give you what you need when you need it.  Tune in today for a timely discussion on a tender topic.<br />

			<itunes:summary>I get letters and emails daily from parents who are struggling to shield their children from the onslaught of the transgender movement. It&amp;#8217;s in our libraries, in &amp;#8220;children&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221; books, in television shows. Today, I am answering a question from a mom who is struggling to speak the truth and wonders where that boldness can be found. Spoiler alert: God will give you what you need when you need it.  Tune in today for a timely discussion on a tender topic.&lt;br /&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Practical Help for Taming Your Child’s Tongue, with Ginger Hubbard ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[&#8220;Did you really just say that?&#8221; I can&#8217;t even count how many times I have thought or said this in a moment of frustration and anger with one of my children. Yes, parenting is hard work — but Ginger Hubbard offers life-giving, practical solutions that even busy parents can implement today by pointing our children (and ourselves) back to the ultimate parenting manual: The Bible. This is one of my favorite podcasts ever—tune in! You will be glad you did.<br />
Scriptures Mentioned<br />
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A5&amp;version=ESV">James 1:5</a><br /><br />
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+12%3A34&amp;version=ESV">Matthew 12:34</a><br /><br />
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+51%3A5&amp;version=ESV">Psalm 51:5<br /><br />
</a><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+6%3A9&amp;version=ESV">Galatians 6:9<br /><br />
</a><br />
<a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/?p=27299">A Blog Post from Ginger: 3 Steps to Taming Your Child&#8217;s Tongue</a><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.GingerHubbard.com">GINGER HUBBARD</a> is a sought-after speaker, author, and an award-winning writer. She has spoken at hundreds of parenting conferences, mom’s events, and homeschool conventions across the country. She is a veteran homeschooling mother of two adult children and stepmom to two much-adored stepsons. She and her husband reside in Opelika, Alabama.<br />
<a href="https://amzn.to/2zVs7vx">I Can&#8217;t Believe You Just Said That!: Biblical Wisdom for Taming Your Child&#8217;s Tongue</a>: Are you ever embarrassed or shocked by what comes out of your child’s mouth? Do you raise your voice, threaten, and coerce, but find yourself frustrated because nothing seems to work?<br />
In I Can’t Believe You Just Said That!, Ginger Hubbard provides a practical, three-step plan to reach beyond the behaviors of tongue-related struggles—such as lying, tattling, and whining—to address your child’s heart. After all, as Matthew 12:34 tells us, “the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.”<br />
By moving past the idea that parenting is about rigid rule-setting or behavior management, we can set aside ineffective practices such as scolding, ignoring the offense, or merely administering punishment. Instead, we start to see that our children’s outbursts are prime opportunities for the ultimate goal of all parenting: to guide them to the redemptive work of Jesus and his transformational power.<br />

She has spoken at hundreds of parenting conferences, mom’s events, and homeschool conventions across the country. She is a veteran homeschooling mother of two adult children and stepmom to two much-adored stepsons. She and her husband reside in Opelika, Alabama.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2zVs7vx&quot;&gt;I Can&amp;#8217;t Believe You Just Said That!: Biblical Wisdom for Taming Your Child&amp;#8217;s Tongue&lt;/a&gt;: Are you ever embarrassed or shocked by what comes out of your child’s mouth? Do you raise your voice, threaten, and coerce, but find yourself frustrated because nothing seems to work?&lt;br /&gt;
In I Can’t Believe You Just Said That!, Ginger Hubbard provides a practical, three-step plan to reach beyond the behaviors of tongue-related struggles—such as lying, tattling, and whining—to address your child’s heart. After all, as Matthew 12:34 tells us, “the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.”&lt;br /&gt;
By moving past the idea that parenting is about rigid rule-setting or behavior management, we can set aside ineffective practices such as scolding, ignoring the offense, or merely administering punishment. Instead, we start to see that our children’s outbursts are prime opportunities for the ultimate goal of all parenting: to guide them to the redemptive work of Jesus and his transformational power.&lt;br /&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Hope for Recovering Control Freaks… Like Me | With Jennifer Dukes Lee]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today, my friend Jennifer is joining me for an encouraging and honest discussion about how very busy we all are—and how it just might come down to issues of control. Jennifer is the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/2LdMeGr">It&#8217;s All Under Control</a>, which releases on the same day as me new book, Prayers for the Battlefield! Listen in, I know you&#8217;re going to be glad you did.<br />
Jennifer Dukes Lee is the author of It&#8217;s All Under Control, along with other books. She is a blogger, a speaker, and a former news reporter for several Midwestern metro newspapers. Jennifer still loves to chase a great story. Nowadays, however, she prefers to write about the remarkably good news of Jesus Christ. Jennifer and her husband live on the Lee family farm in Iowa, where they raise crops, pigs, and two beautiful humans. She attends a small country church, where some Sundays you&#8217;ll find her spinning tunes as the church DJ. She&#8217;s a big fan of dark chocolate, emojis, eighties music, bright lipstick, and Netflix binges. She wants to live life in such a way that you can&#8217;t help but want more of Jesus.<br />

In The Essential Guide to Spiritual Warfare, Neil Anderson and Timothy Warner describe the battle between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of darkness, a battle for the minds and hearts of us all. Learn about the importance of having a biblical worldview and how to prepare for the battle you are called to fight.

With passion and clarity, Dr. Evans demystifies spiritual warfare so that readers can tackle challenges and obstacles with spiritual power―God&#8217;s authority!<br />

			<title><![CDATA[From Victim to Victory ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[It seems that it&#8217;s popular in the culture today to embrace a posture of victimization. We&#8217;re victims because of the circumstances of our birth, our financial background, our race or our gender. Many people are angry over things that happened generations ago—and rather than embrace a posture of gratefulness for what God has done, they embrace an identity that&#8217;s wrapped up in victimization. Men and women of God—this is not who you are in Christ! God says you are more than conquerers through Christ Jesus! Join me today as I talk about how to move from victim to victory! God has good things for you, starting with freedom from your past and power for the future.<br />
Ephesians 1:19-22<br />

			<itunes:summary>It seems that it&amp;#8217;s popular in the culture today to embrace a posture of victimization. We&amp;#8217;re victims because of the circumstances of our birth, our financial background, our race or our gender. Many people are angry over things that happened generations ago—and rather than embrace a posture of gratefulness for what God has done, they embrace an identity that&amp;#8217;s wrapped up in victimization. Men and women of God—this is not who you are in Christ! God says you are more than conquerers through Christ Jesus! Join me today as I talk about how to move from victim to victory! God has good things for you, starting with freedom from your past and power for the future.&lt;br /&gt;
Ephesians 1:19-22&lt;br /&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Is It Time to Downsize? Interview with Steve Lambert]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Are you a slave to your belongings?  Do you spend more time caring for them than enjoying them? Do they keep you from living a healthy full life and spending time with others you love? Will your children be saddled with generations of hand me downs when you pass? These are important questions to ask as we learn to be good stewards of the resources we&#8217;ve been given: money, time, and relationships. Don&#8217;t miss my interview with one of my favorite people, Steve Lambert as we talk about the challenge of managing our things.<br />
<br />
Steve Lambert has worn many hats in his 68 years: pastor, author, speaker, stock broker and more. Together, he and his wife Jane Claire Lambert created and publish <a href="http://fiveinarow.com">Five in a Row</a> homeschool curriculum which has been a homeschool mainstay for nearly 25 years. They began homeschooling their children in 1981 and today their seven grandchildren are being homeschooled as well and range in age from 18 months to 18 years.<br />

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Family secrets are obviously secrets because they are difficult situations, but leaving difficulties in the dark is one of the worst things we can do. I talk with my guest today about how we can get those secrets out in the open and begin to heal.<br>
&nbsp;Beth K. Vogt is a nonfiction author and editor who said she’d never write fiction. She’s the wife of an Air Force family physician (now in solo practice) who said she’d never marry a doctor—or anyone in the military. She’s a mom of four who said she’d never have kids. Now Beth believes God’s best often waits behind the doors marked “Never.” A women’s fiction novelist, Beth’s first novel for Tyndale House Publishers,<br>
<a href="https://amzn.to/2JqXBKi">Things I Never Told You</a>, releases May 2018.<br>

A November Bride was part of the Year of Wedding series by Zondervan. Having authored nine contemporary romance novels or novellas, Beth believes there’s more to happily-ever-after than the fairy tales tell us.<br>

			<itunes:summary>I&amp;#8217;m excited to have my friend, author and speaker Sheila Gregoire on the show today! We&amp;#8217;ll be talking about how to take the &amp;#8220;awkward&amp;#8221; out of talking about sex and why it&amp;#8217;s so important to teach our daughters about God&amp;#8217;s beautiful design for sex and for their bodies. Don&amp;#8217;t miss this important conversation!  Includes a link to a brand-new e-course called &amp;#8220;The Whole Story&amp;#8221; which has been designed to help you talk to your daughter about tender topics like body development and hygiene etc.  This podcast is rated &amp;#8220;M&amp;#8221; for mothers!  I know you&amp;#8217;ll be encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;
Sheila Wray Gregoire is a popular speaker, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tolovehonorandvacuum.com/&quot;&gt;marriage blogger&lt;/a&gt;, and the author of eight books, including The Good Girl&amp;#8217;s Guide to Great Sex. She loves encouraging women in their relationships, both with God and with their husbands, children, and friends. Her passion is for marriage, and she and her husband Keith speak together at marriage outreaches and at FamilyLife Canada marriage conferences. Sheila believes in authenticity, and gives real solutions to the very real and messy problems women and couples can face. You can usually find her in Belleville, Ontario, where she&amp;#8217;s constantly texting her two young adult daughters and knitting. Preferably simultaneously.&lt;br /&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Christians and Unrepentance: What’s Our Response?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today, I&#8217;ll be tackling the tough topic of what to do when a brother or sister in Christ decides to live in a way that displeases the Lord. These are tough questions, but God has answers. We are called to speak the truth in love. The Bible teaches that we are to be known for our love. Any other way is a cheap substitute for the love that God has shown us. I&#8217;ll also be addressing the question of Christian schools. Tune in and be encouraged!<br />

			<title><![CDATA[So Close to Amazing, with KariAnne Wood]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Have you ever felt like you were chasing tomorrow—never satisfied with today?  Join me and my friend, KariAnne Wood as we laugh and talk about how to find peace in the everyday challenges of life.<br />
She has blue feet today—but she&#8217;s still smiling! Come find out why—I think you&#8217;ll be encouraged!<br />
<a href="http://momstronginternational.com"></a><br />
<br />
KariAnne Wood writes the decorating and lifestyle blog <a href="https://thistlewoodfarms.com/blog/">Thistlewood Farms</a> from her project-filled historic home in Dallas, Texas. She recently followed God&#8217;s call and jumped back &#8220;home&#8221; with her family from the middle of the country to the busy Dallas metroplex where she lives with her husband and four children.If you wander down the tree-lined streets of KariAnne&#8217;s beloved hometown, McKinney, you might find her painting mismatched chairs, listening to Christmas carols no matter the season, singing Scripture, or walking hand in hand with her knight-in-shining-armor husband to a Friday night football game. She loves sweet tea with lime, thunderstorms, good books, milk glass, and yard sales, and she is an imperfect DIYer saved by grace.<br />
<br />
KariAnne&#8217;s new book, <a href="https://amzn.to/2KVJtcW">So Close to Amazing</a>, is a book celebrating the incredible, awesome, special individual within each of us. It’s also a book for anyone who has ever mismatched her shoes or trimmed her own bangs when a professional might have been a better choice or added too much soap to the washer and watched it overflow.<br />
<br />
Thistlewood Farms is full of stories of family and faith and features hundreds of the home decor projects KariAnne creates every week for readers. The blog was awarded the Country Living Decorating Blog of the Year, was named one of the Top 10 Decorating Blogs by Better Homes and Gardens, and was voted one of the best DIY blogs of 2015. KariAnne has been featured in Better Homes and Gardens Christmas Ideas, Country Living, Flea Market Décor, Country Woman, HGTV Magazine, the Cottage Journal, the Chicago Tribune, Reloved, and This Old House magazine, and on popular websites including the Today show, Better Homes and Gardens, Country Living, Apartment Therapy, Good Housekeeping, Mediakix, Bob Vila, and BuzzFeed. KariAnne has made appearances on television programs including Nashville Channel 5&#8217;s Talk of the Town and Channel 8 in Dallas.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[Head’s Up, California (and the Rest of the World)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Every week, listeners send me news clips and videos about things that are happening in the rapidly escalating war against Christianity in the culture. Two weeks ago, God&#8217;s grace rested on California homeschoolers as nearly 3000 of them showed up to defend their right to homeschool. THIS WEEK&#8217;s challenge puts foster children in extreme danger of being indoctrinated into transgenderism and threatens pastors and other Christian leaders who want to help those who want out of same-sex attraction and/or transgenderism.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;m highlighting California, but it&#8217;s a shot across the bow for the rest of the world. Listen and find out how you can engage and make a difference in the battle for faith and freedom starting today.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[Strategies in Spiritual Warfare: Are You READY to Share the Gospel?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Do you feel it? Have you noticed? The battle for the souls of men is raging right now. So many things are happening in our world, highlighting both the good and the evil that resides in the hearts of men. We are at war, but  praise God—He did not leave us in the world to struggle on our own.<br />
For the next several weeks, MomStrong International moms are laser-focused on girding up for battle. This week, we&#8217;re taking a look at what it means to have our feet &#8220;fitted&#8221; with the gospel of peace. <br />
Look with me at the first part of Ephesians 6:15. “And with your feet fitted” is where Paul starts off teaching about this vital piece of God’s armor. So what does it mean to be “fitted?” Are you fitted? Are you ready to share God&#8217;s love with others? You can be! Tune in and let&#8217;s talk about it!<br />
Scriptures<br />
1 Peter 1:3<br />
Ephesians 6:15<br />
2 Corinthians 5:20<br />

			<title><![CDATA[The Blessing of Obedience ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[I say often that there is a blessing in obedience, and a podcast listener has asked me to explain that concept.   We are taught at a very early age to obey our parents, and the Bible says blessed are those who hear God&#8217;s way and obey it. God&#8217;s blessings are never found outside of his boundaries, even if it might look like it on the outside of a situation.  We&#8217;re also talking about homeschool burnout, which kind of speaks for itself.

			<title><![CDATA[Choosing to Live like God is Bigger: Living Victoriously with PTSD, with Jenna Wood ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[My friend Jenna shares her story of learning how to live without panic after witnessing a shooting, and choosing to believe that God is bigger than the trials that come in this world in which we find ourselves. Don&#8217;t miss this interview with one of my MomStrong International leaders as she shares how she&#8217; is learning to live victoriously, even with PTSD.<br />
Jenna has been married to her husband, Ben, since 2013. Their son, Ethan, is 2 and a half years old and loves all sports &#8211; basketball, soccer, football, and especially golf. Jenna was on the “Becoming MomStrong” Launch Team and most recently led a Becoming MomStrong Book Study in the same Panera Bread she’d once run from in fear. Jenna longs to see women experience the true freedom that is found only in Jesus Christ. There is no story that He cannot redeem and restore. Jenna can often be found lost in a good book and she believes chocolate was created especially with women in mind. She has an affinity for all things pink, navy blue, and nautical.  <a href="https://anchoredhopejoyfulpromise.blogspot.com/2018/02/the-panera-bread-shooting-two-years.html">Read more of Jenna&#8217;s story here!</a><br />

			<description><![CDATA[It&#8217;s easy to become overwhelmed with our schedules, and we&#8217;d probably all be lying if we didn&#8217;t admit to being there at least once ourselves! In fact, I wrote a book about that! But there are some things you can do to keep from being beat!  Let&#8217;s talk about some practical and spiritual strategies today, busy mom!<br />

<a href="http://amzn.to/1GqPLNJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crazy Busy: A Mercifully Short Book about a (Really) Big Problem by Kevin DeYoung</a> &#8211; I’M TOO BUSY!” We’ve all heard it. We’ve all said it. All too often, busyness gets the best of us.  Just one look at our jam-packed schedules tells us how hard it can be to strike a well-reasoned balance between doing nothing and doing it all.  That’s why award-winning author and pastor Kevin DeYoung addresses the busyness problem head on in his newest book, Crazy Busy — and not with the typical arsenal of time management tips, but rather with the biblical tools we need to get to the source of the issue and pull the problem out by the roots.  Highly practical and super short, Crazy Busy will help you put an end to “busyness as usual.&#8221;<br />

			<title><![CDATA[Just Open the Door, with Jen Schmidt]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Do you enjoy being hospitable or is it more effort than it&#8217;s worth?  Do you struggle with insecurity over an undecorated house or lack of confidence in your cooking skills? You are not alone, sister! But it&#8217;s important to move past those roadblocks #sothat you can experience and share the blessing of being hospitable.  Let&#8217;s Just Open the Door together, women!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
{ <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog?p=27098">Read the Companion Blog Post Here</a> }<br />
For the last decade, Jen Schmidt has been encouraging, challenging, and cheering on women to embrace both the beauty and bedlam of their everyday lives on her popular lifestyle blog, <a href="http://beautyandbedlam.com/">Balancing Beauty and Bedlam</a>. With a variety of topics—from easy dinner ideas and personal finance to leaving a legacy—Jen equips others to live life to its fullest, reminding them it&#8217;s the little things that really are the big things in life. A popular speaker, worship leader and founder/host of the annual <a href="https://thebecomingconf.wordpress.com/">Becoming Conference</a>, Jen shares with humor and authenticity as she invites others to join her on this bumpy, beautiful life journey. She lives in North Carolina with her husband, five children, a few too many animals, and an available sofa for anyone who needs it.<br />
<a href="https://amzn.to/2utxeAi">Just Open the Door</a> , by Jen Schmidt<br />
For many of us, inviting people into our lives and homes feels more like inviting judgment on our entertaining skills and stress on our already maxed-out schedules. But what if you knew that opening your front door had the power to radically change the world? To make an impact and leave a legacy with everyday invitations?<br />
Jen Schmidt has set out to reframe how we think about hospitality and to equip us to walk a road of welcome in our daily lives. Jen knows that every time we choose open-door living—whether in our homes or by taking hospitality on the road just like Jesus—those we invite in get to experience the lived-out Gospel, our kids grow up in a life-lab of generosity, and we trade insecurity for connection.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[Raising World Changers, with Kristen Welch]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[At 45 years old, my friend Kristen Welch talks about failing most of her parenting tests. But the Lord stirred the hearts of Kristen and her husband, and they started changing the way they handled &#8220;blessings&#8221; in their lives. Don&#8217;t miss the way Kristen describes the changes they&#8217;ve made in their family as they make a great effort to Raise World Changers by being World Changers themselves.<br />
A Bit About my Guest<br />
Kristen Welch is a native Texan, a wife and mom. She began blogging about her life on <a href="http://wearethatfamily.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wearethatfamily.com</a> nearly a decade ago. Over the years, Kristen has grown a vast following of moms who identify with her real, often funny, and always inspiring writing.<br /><br />
In 2010, she traveled with Compassion International to Kenya on a blogging trip to write about poverty in a huge slum. That experience turned her world upside down, and as a result, she and her family founded <a href="http://wearethatfamily.com/the-mercy-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a non-profit called Mercy House</a>. The organization funds maternity centers for pregnant teens living in extreme poverty and manages <a href="http://wearethatfamily.com/the-mercy-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fair Trade Friday</a>, a monthly subscription club that allows thousands of women in America to support impoverished women around the globe by purchasing the fairly traded product they create.<br /><br />
Kristen is the author of multiple books, including <a href="http://amzn.to/2dHQFbz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rhinestone Jesus: Saying Yes to God when Sparkly Safe Faith is No Longer Enough</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/2e0cxCU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raising Grateful Kids in an Entitled World: How One Family Learned That Saying No Can Lead to Life’s Biggest Yes</a>. Kristen&#8217;s new book, <a href="http://wearethatfamily.com/raising-world-changers/">Raising World Changers</a>, has just released!<br /><br />
Kristen’s blog following continues to grow, and many of the readers financially support the work of Mercy House. When she and her family aren’t traveling to Kenya, Kristen and her husband and their three children live in Magnolia, Texas, where they enjoy going to football games, flea markets, trying new restaurants and working with displaced refugees in Houston.<br />

			<description><![CDATA[It it&#8217;s important to Paul, it should be important to us. Sound doctrine is important, because Christianity is based on the Gospel, and the teaching of the church should be defined by Scripture.

			<description><![CDATA[Living in bitterness will eat you alive from the inside, and there are times when we need to emotionally disentangle ourselves.  But doing that without forgiving and letting go of your bitterness is still giving them power that will rob you of your joy. Let&#8217;s talk a little bit about this today. We can learn to move on!<br />

Hebrews 12:15<br /><br />

<a href="http://amzn.to/1K2GvKk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Gift of Forgiveness by Charles Stanley</a> &#8211; Charles Stanley, one of the most influential spiritual leaders of our day, shares the key to personal and even world peace in The Gift of Forgiveness. as Stanley points out that no sin is so shockingly evil it blocks God&#8217;s forgiveness nor so trivial it negates the need for God&#8217;s mercy, he shares the specifics of how to go about receiving and giving forgiveness.<br />
The Gift of Forgiveness reflects the heart of Stanley&#8217;s teaching ministry. In this markedly helpful book, Stanley addresses such questions as how to practice a life of forgiveness in all your relationships and how to make forgiveness an ongoing, practical experience in your life.<br />
<a href="http://amzn.to/1Ov9mgL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Forgiveness</a> by John MacArthur &#8211; &#8220;The greatest measuring rod of love in the life of a Christian may be forgiveness, because God showed His love to us in terms of forgiveness.&#8221; ?John MacArthur<br />
Does anyone really want to forgive? Or admit that we need forgiveness? Whether we&#8217;re giving or receiving, forgiveness is hard. It seems unfair. It feels unnatural. And as best-selling author and pastor John MacArthur demonstrates, forgiveness apart from Christ is unnatural. It is only as we understand our need, Christ&#8217;s power and example, and what it reallly means to love that we can embrace two of the most liberating acts of love: forgiving and being forgiven.<br />

			<description><![CDATA[God is the source of all good things, and it&#8217;s critical that we pass this concept on to our children. Join me with my new friend, Katie Bennett as we spend our second podcast talking about living simply in light of eternity. It&#8217;s another way we can join in #becomingmomstrong !<br />

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
More About Heavenly Minded Mom: The lives of moms are all too often consumed with wearisome, empty striving. We work to keep up appearances, meet worldly standards, and find satisfaction in the offerings of this life such as success, admiration, and ease. However, God has set eternity in a mother’s heart, and deep inside, we long for more.<br />
In Heavenly Minded Mom, Katie Bennett beckons us into a new way of viewing our present reality by rising above the ordinary and routine to see a bigger plan and purpose for motherhood.<br />
This uplifting book offers moms the wisdom of Ecclesiastes, wrapped in the hope of the Gospel, and presented in bite-sized portions.  The 90 compelling meditations, scripture readings, and invitations to journal and reflect, will encourage us to reevaluate how we envision our lives and to claim a heavenly mindset towards our mothering tasks.  These inspirational readings will help us discover a new way of looking at our responsibilities as a mom through God’s eyes.<br />
Embrace a simpler life filled with God’s promises and love as you reflect on God’s powerful work as it has woven through your past and present in anticipation of its impact in the future and your spiritual legacy.<br />

			<description><![CDATA[Christians are getting less and less discerning and in turn, giving false teachers greater audiences to share their twisted versions of the Gospel.  It matters, men and women, who we are listening to.  Today we&#8217;re looking at three specific traits of false teachers, because learning how to recognize them is the first wise move we make to stand firm against them!<br />

If there was ever a time to be on the lookout for them, the time is now. We are living in a generation of biblically illiterate, immature Christians—people who, while they claim the name of Jesus, and who want His mercy, forgiveness and salvation, do not wish to carry His cross.<br />

We all agree that teaching our children the life-changing truths of the Bible is one of our most important jobs as parents. But where do we begin? How do we consistently explore God’s Word in a way that helps our children understand and apply the core truths of biblical teaching in their own lives? The Firmly Planted Family Series is divided into ten-week studies and is your key to making sense of the Bible—even if you’re learning right along with your children. Each lesson provides a core idea, a simple narrative, memory verses and discussion questions for children of all ages. And the companion student workbook is filled with age-appropriate, full-color, reproducible activities for children of any age!<br />

In an age of open-mindedness, many believers accept too much with too little discernment, resulting in great confusion and compromise. But God&#8217;s Word makes it clear that not everything that glitters is gold. False teaching is at every turn, and the temptation to embrace it is great. As God&#8217;s people we are called to sift through the overwhelming number of traditions and trends and use the truth of Scripture to determine which are the true treasures-and which are &#8220;fool&#8217;s gold.&#8221;<br />
General editor John MacArthur and the contributors of this uncompromising book define the principles of biblical discernment and use them to address several contemporary Christian issues. They provide straightforward, biblical critiques of some popular but unfortunate Christian trends, such as watered-down preaching and doctrinally questionable best-selling books.

			<title><![CDATA[A Homeschooling Threat and Feeding the 5000 ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[It would appear that in Hawaii the future of homeschooling is in jeopardy, which will tempt many of us to wring our hands in fear as we wonder what precedent will be set for our own states. But our other topic for today speaks to this one, and that is that we serve a God who can do anything. So before we surrender in fear, let&#8217;s do what we can and trust the Lord to work &#8211; just like He did when He fed a crowd of 5000 with a few loaves and fish all those years ago. He is still our all powerful God!<br />

			<title><![CDATA[Why I’m Not a Feminist ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[The feminists in our world today are fighting for freedom to reject God as the ultimate authority in our life. I am 100% pro-woman and believe 100% that men and women are equal, but we are different, and that is GOOD. God has a beautiful design for the women He created, and we rob ourselves of the joy He offers if we reject that design for our lives. I&#8217;m encouraging you to walk in the way the Lord has laid out for His people, one that fully recognizes the beauty in His creation, uniquely and individually gifted male and female.<br />

			<itunes:summary>The feminists in our world today are fighting for freedom to reject God as the ultimate authority in our life. I am 100% pro-woman and believe 100% that men and women are equal, but we are different, and that is GOOD. God has a beautiful design for the women He created, and we rob ourselves of the joy He offers if we reject that design for our lives. I&amp;#8217;m encouraging you to walk in the way the Lord has laid out for His people, one that fully recognizes the beauty in His creation, uniquely and individually gifted male and female.&lt;br /&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Who Is Jesus?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Jesus is the Son of God, but why do we struggle with belief? It&#8217;s so important for us to remember that we are to find our answers in the Word of God &#8211; we go no other place. We must begin to know God&#8217;s Word for ourselves, so that we can defend the truth contained in it and recognize the false teaching that is rampant in our culture today. We&#8217;re going back to the basics, and calling out a false teaching being taught by the Episcopalian church as we speak. We want to pass the truth of God&#8217;s Word on to the next generation, and to understand how to do that, we need to know who Jesus is.<br />
Scripture: John 5:16-47<br />
Key verse: John 5:24<br />

			<description><![CDATA[Scriptures<br />
Psalm 90:12<br />
Ephesians 5:15-18<br />
Psalm 139:4<br />
More Like This from The Busy Mom<br />
<a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog//?p=22988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Busy Seasons and Weary Souls</a> &#8211; God doesn&#8217;t clearly tell us in his Word what is too much or too little when it comes to busyness. That&#8217;s something we each have to walk out with him. What He does tell us though, is that He wants us to be about HIS business&#8230;His agenda. In other words, to be led by the Holy Spirit. Being too busy is only okay if it&#8217;s what He wants us to do.<br />
<a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog//?p=14150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Balance for Busy Moms</a> &#8211; So what does this have to do with balance?  First, we need to work to please God, not others.  Second, and it may not seem obvious at first, but if you read from verse 17  back down to that parallel verse, verse 23, you will see something that stood out to me:  I noticed that all of the verses in between 17 and 23 talk about the importance of relationships. Those verses are all about healthy family relationships: wives and husbands are supposed to be in loving relationships with each other; we read that fathers are not to exasperate their children.  God&#8217;s Word is telling us that good works situations and healthy family situations go hand in hand.  This takes prioritizing and balancing.  Sometimes, good things rob us of the best things.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[True Transformation ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[A true transformation will manifest by us rejoicing in the goodness of the Lord in every area of our lives. Because we know that the God of the Universe keeps His promises, we can be at peace, because we are going to see the Lord at the end of our lives! We&#8217;re learning what a true transformation meant in the life of Nicodemus, a Pharisee ruler, who was told by Jesus that he needed to be born again. Nicodemus had quite a pedigree, but he didn&#8217;t have what really mattered &#8211; a belief in Jesus Christ as His Savior.<br /><br />

			<title><![CDATA[The Power of the Spoken Word]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[God has invited us to come into His presence, and when we do that, we&#8217;re submitting that we can&#8217;t do this life without Him. The power of the spoken word can encourage others, it is an opportunity to proclaim promises and can increase our faith. We can speak His promises right back to Him! It&#8217;s a powerful way to communicate with the Lord, but not everyone likes praying out loud.  Listen in while I talk about that today.<br />
Romans 10:7<br />
Daniel 6:10<br />
Psalm 42:1-2<br />
Isaiah 25:1<br />
More from The Busy Mom:<br />
<a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog//?p=13137">Teach me to Pray</a> &#8211; A couple minute podcast and short post where Heidi St. John reminds us that God wants to talk to us in prayer. It&#8217;s vital to live a thriving, grounded and humble life.<br />
Resources<br />
<a href="http://amzn.to/1EPRrds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Praying Life</a> &#8211; Author Paul Miller shares his insights and conclusions about how to connect the broken pieces of your life and allow prayer—even poorly delivered—to fill the gaps with meaning and substance.  Miller&#8217;s down-to-earth approach and practical nature will help you see that your relationship with God can grow and your communication with Him can get better.  Parents will find Miller&#8217;s family-life experiences especially helpful.<br />
<a href="http://amzn.to/1hUKtip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lord, Teach Us To Pray</a> &#8211;<br />
Since this book was published over a century ago, countless readers have learned through its pages that no one can teach prayer better than Jesus Christ himself. This enduring classic will transform your prayers and life as you open your heart to the prayer-lessons Jesus gave.<br /><br />
&#8220;The Father waits to hear every prayer of faith. He wants to give us whatever we ask for in Jesus&#8217; name. If there is one thing I think the Church needs to learn, it is that God intends prayer to have an answer, and that we have not yet fully conceived of what God will do for us if we believe that our prayers will be heard. God hears prayer.&#8221;<br />

			<title><![CDATA[All the Pretty Things: A Story of Healing and Hope, with Edie Wadsworth ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[I have a friend joining me today, and we&#8217;re talking about God making beauty out of ashes in our lives.  Edie and I have similar stories, and thankfully, we both have similar redemption to share as well! We&#8217;re also talking about never giving up, so if you&#8217;re someone who has tried and tried and just can&#8217;t stick to something, I know you&#8217;ll be encouraged!<br />
<a href="http://amzn.to/2r1S9Zq">All the Pretty Things</a> &#8211; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how old I was the night the trailer burned down, or if the rumor was true that Daddy was the one who set it on fire.&#8221;<br />
For a long time, Edie thought she had escaped. It started in an Appalachian trailer park, where a young girl dreamed of becoming a doctor. But every day, Edie woke up to her reality: a poverty-stricken world full of alcohol and violence, where getting out seemed impossible. She taught herself to drive a stick shift truck at twelve years old so she could get her drunk daddy home from the bar. She spent Saturdays at Brushy Mountain prison visiting her incarcerated cousin. She watched adults eat while her stomach gnawed and then there was torching of the family trailer, where she dug through the ashes to try to salvage her most prized possession&#8211;her Tammy Wynette album.<br />
And at the center of it all was her charismatic daddy. She never knew when he would show up but when he did he was usually drunk; she learned the hard way that she couldn&#8217;t count on him to protect her. So she told herself it didn&#8217;t matter. All she wanted was to make him proud. Against all odds, Edie &#8220;made doctor,&#8221; achieving everything that had once seemed beyond her reach. Only, it was too late, because her Daddy died a year before she graduated medical school. She split the cost of his funeral with her sister.<br />
When her past finally caught up with her, it was all too much so she did what her Daddy would have done&#8211;she set it all on fire. It would take her whole life burning down once again for Edie to be finally able to face the truth about herself, her family, and her relationship with God.<a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/oils"></a><br />

			<title><![CDATA[Disputable Matters: A Conversation about Christian Liberty and Responsibility ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In John 2, Jesus saved the best wine – for last. The gospel of John gives a brief description of the first miracle performed by Jesus – changing water into wine at a wedding in Cana (John1:1-10). Keep in mind, this was not a Christian wedding: for one thing—no one believed in Him yet, including His own brothers (John 7:1-50). This was the first of many miracles performed by Jesus when He walked on earth, a sort of precursor to what He was capable of doing, an “opening act,” if you will.<br />
But wait? Did someone say “wine?” <br />
And there you have it: one of the most disputed topics in the Church today. How can we be ambassadors for Christ in every situation? Good question! Let&#8217;s talk about our liberty and our responsibility as Christians today at the podcast.  {This podcast is based on week 3 of the study at MomStrong International.

<a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog//?p=810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homeschooling Held Hostage</a> &#8211;<br />
We&#8217;ve gone from a few brave moms who, without access to mainstream &#8220;curriculum&#8221;, managed to give their children an excellent education—but we&#8217;ve forgotten what made it excellent.<br />
It was excellent because these moms had a vision for homeschooling—they weren&#8217;t trying to re-create school at home. They were simply being obedient to the One who had called them to be different. They knew that if He had called them, He would equip them.<br />

We&amp;#8217;ve gone from a few brave moms who, without access to mainstream &amp;#8220;curriculum&amp;#8221;, managed to give their children an excellent education—but we&amp;#8217;ve forgotten what made it excellent.&lt;br /&gt;
It was excellent because these moms had a vision for homeschooling—they weren&amp;#8217;t trying to re-create school at home. They were simply being obedient to the One who had called them to be different. They knew that if He had called them, He would equip them.&lt;br /&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Pray, Prioritize, Proceed]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Are you weary? It’s no wonder. Today’s moms are busier than ever. We’re signing our kids up for everything from athletics to music and the arts. In truth, most moms I’ve met in recent years are exhausted, worn out women who admit to feeling “guilty” if they don’t provide their children with every imaginable opportunity. These well-meaning moms are running from sun-up to sun-down, often sacrificing their own personal margin and time with the Lord, leaving them weary and disillusioned. We’re just.so.busy.<br />
Why? I wonder: is there more to this busyness than meets the eye? If everything we do carries eternal significance with it, then surely, our Creator must have direction for our everyday decisions. Even when we sign up for soccer.<br />
We are doing holy work, you know.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[Loving Your Actual Christmas, with Alexandra Kuykendall]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[I have my friend Alexandra Kuykendall on with me today and we&#8217;re talking more about enjoying Christmas for what it is, learning to relish what is right in front of us and focusing on what really matters. Less is truly more in this season!<br />
You can read more about Alexandra Kuykendall’s experiment to put an end to the holiday madness in her new book <a href="http://amzn.to/2CYHAYu">Loving My Actual Christmas: An Experiment in Relishing the Season</a>. A trusted voice in mothering circles, Alex speaks to women around the world about issues of parenting, faith and identity. She is the Cohost of <a href="http://theopendoorsisterhood.com/podcast/">The Open Door Sisterhood Podcast</a> and has also authored <a href="http://amzn.to/2BPyP3r">Loving My Actual Life</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/2kZxbEg">The Artist’s Daughter</a>. Alex lives in the shadows of downtown Denver with her husband Derek and their 4 daughters who range in age from 15 to 6. You can connect with her at <a href="http://alexandrakuykendall.com/alex/">AlexandraKuykendall.com</a>.<br />
<a href="http://amzn.to/2kXYDlW">Loving My Actual Christmas: An Experiment in Relishing the Season</a> &#8211; The Christmas season is a particularly difficult time for women to slow down and relish what&#8217;s right in front of them. An annual marker for many, it is a holiday that can often remind us how life is not going as we&#8217;d planned. Our family relationships remain strained, our finances stretched, and our schedules stuffed with too much to do in too little time.<br />
Following the formula of her successful Loving My Actual Life, Alexandra Kuykendall shares with readers her own personal experiment to be completely present in her life as it is during the holiday season. Addressing the themes of Advent and Christmas, she reflects on hope, love, joy, peace, and relishing the season, with practical pullouts on common Christmas stressors, such as finances, schedules, and extended family. Kuykendall&#8217;s signature candor helps women go easy on themselves, remember what truly matters, and find joy in their imperfect Christmases.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[Whom Do You Trust? ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[There is so much happening in the news right centering around the sexual misconduct of public figures, from news organizations to government. It&#8217;s curious to me how outraged we are by one kind of sexual sin—and how we promote other kinds. In Psalm 1, we learn about the life God blesses.<br />
God repeatedly warns us about the consequences of sexual sin in His Word. We dare not fall into the trap of culturally correct Christianity. God says that ALL sexual activity outside the bounds of heterosexual, monogamous marriage is sin. So who do we trust? Do we trust the world&#8217;s wisdom, or do we trust God? Listen in, I think you&#8217;ll be encouraged!<br />
Mentioned in Podcast:<br /><br />
<a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/preventingrace/2017/11/30/youre-matt-lauer-morning-heres/">Patheos article</a><br />
Psalm 1<br />
1<br /><br />
Oh, the joys of those who do not<br /><br />
follow the advice of the wicked,<br /><br />
or stand around with sinners,<br /><br />
or join in with mockers.<br /><br />
2<br /><br />
But they delight in the law of the Lord,<br /><br />
meditating on it day and night.<br /><br />
3<br /><br />
They are like trees planted along the riverbank,<br /><br />
bearing fruit each season.<br /><br />
Their leaves never wither,<br /><br />
and they prosper in all they do.<br /><br />
4<br /><br />
But not the wicked!<br /><br />
They are like worthless chaff, scattered by the wind.<br /><br />
5<br /><br />
They will be condemned at the time of judgment.<br /><br />
Sinners will have no place among the godly.<br /><br />
6<br /><br />
For the Lord watches over the path of the godly,<br /><br />
but the path of the wicked leads to destruction.<br />

Last time we talked about mom anger, because some of our friends had a problem.  Ha!  Just kidding&amp;#8230; because we both know WE are guilty! But Wendy has a great resource for anyone who admits it&amp;#8217;s an issue.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://heidistjohn.com/blog/?p=26608&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://heidistjohn.com/blog/?p=26609&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[The Power of Weakness ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In our world today, power, strength and greatness are definitely what our culture has decided are worth fighting for. Yet in God&#8217;s economy, we&#8217;re told that weakness is where we find our reward.  Join me as we figure this one out.<br />
Scriptures<br />
2 Corinthians 12: 1-10<br />
Ephesians 3:20-21<br />
Mentioned in the Podcast<br />
<a title="New Morning Mercies" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1433541386/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1433541386&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thbumo0c-20&amp;linkId=KCSEIMGIQAU32KLX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Morning Mercie</a>s by Paul David Tripp<br />
Mornings can be tough. Sometimes, a hearty breakfast and strong cup of coffee just aren’t enough. Offering more than a rush of caffeine, best-selling author Paul David Tripp wants to energize you with the most potent encouragement imaginable: the gospel.<br />
Forget “behavior modification” or feel-good aphorisms. Tripp knows that what we really need is an encounter with the living God. Then we’ll be prepared to trust in God’s goodness, rely on his grace, and live for his glory each and every day.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[The Preciousness of Others]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Last week, I answered a question from a reader about breastfeeding in public. <br />
What I wanted to do was to get to the root of a fruit which gives license to disregard the thoughts and feelings of others. I wanted to open a dialogue about the old-fashioned idea of putting others first—and instead, I hit a nerve that tells me we have a very real problem as women—one that&#8217;s worth talking about.<br />
This is not about breastfeeding.<br />
I have breastfed all seven of my sweet babies. I&#8217;ve nursed them in public—on trains, planes and in restaurants and libraries. I&#8217;m an advocate of breastfeeding—so this is not about that. This is about being considerate of others.<br />
Women, a new generation of girls are watching us. Social media is watching. Our daughters and nieces and watching. Teachers, your students are watching. Are we &#8220;lording&#8221; our rights over others, or are we being examples of beauty and grace?  The ability to bear and nurse babies is a precious gift—just like the precious responsibility of modeling thoughtful behavior to the children we are blessed to call our own.<br />
Influence is a gift. And that&#8217;s what this is really about. Are we influencing others in such a way that our lives say, &#8220;I think you&#8217;re precious?&#8221;  Human beings are precious to God—therefore—they should be precious to us. Jesus Christ laid down His rights for us—even to the point of going to the cross. He is the example we are called to follow.<br />
Today on the podcast, I&#8217;ll unpack a little of what happened and explain why I believe this is a conversation that women need to have—in love—and with the heart of Christ.<br />

<a href="http://www.firmlyplantedfamily.org/pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firmly Planted Family Bible Study</a><br />
We all agree that teaching our children the life-changing truths of the Bible is one of our most important jobs as parents. But where do we begin? How do we consistently explore God’s Word in a way that helps our children understand and apply the core truths of biblical teaching in their own lives? The Firmly Planted Family Series is divided into ten-week studies and is your key to making sense of the Bible—even if you’re learning right along with your children. Each lesson provides a core idea, a simple narrative, memory verses and discussion questions for children of all ages. And the companion student workbook is filled with age-appropriate, full-color, reproducible activities for children of any age!<br />
<a style="font-weight: bold;" title="Victory in Spiritual Warfare" href="http://amzn.to/1hb9vcH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Victory in Spiritual Warfare: Outfitting Yourself for the Battle</a><br />
Dr. Tony Evans, one of the most respected church leaders in the country, is the founder and senior pastor of Oak Cliff Bible Fellowship in Dallas, a thriving congregation of 8000. In this timely, unique exploration of spiritual warfare, Dr. Evans unveils a simple yet radical truth: every struggle and conflict faced in the physical realm has its root in the spiritual realm.<br />
With passion and clarity, Dr. Evans demystifies spiritual warfare so that readers can tackle challenges and obstacles with spiritual power―God&#8217;s authority!<br />
<a title="Power of a Praying Parent" href="http://amzn.to/1IOVVb3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Power of a Praying Parent</a><br />
Stormie Omartian&#8217;s bestselling The Power of a Praying(R) series (more than 28 million copies sold) is rereleased with fresh new covers and new material to reach a still-growing market of readers eager to discover the power of prayer for their lives.<br />
<a title="Fools Gold" href="http://amzn.to/1IOW9yW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fool&#8217;s Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error</a> edited by Dr. John MacArthur<br />
In an age of open-mindedness, many believers accept too much with too little discernment, resulting in great confusion and compromise. But God&#8217;s Word makes it clear that not everything that glitters is gold. False teaching is at every turn, and the temptation to embrace it is great. As God&#8217;s people we are called to sift through the overwhelming number of traditions and trends and use the truth of Scripture to determine which are the true treasures-and which are &#8220;fool&#8217;s gold.&#8221;<br />

			<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;ve been sick for a week, so we&#8217;re revisiting this one today: Are we growing in our walk with God? Today, we&#8217;re talking about a &#8220;big&#8221; word &#8230; sanctification. It&#8217;s a big word that means a simple thing: grow.  Grow.

General editor John MacArthur and the contributors of this uncompromising book define the principles of biblical discernment and use them to address several contemporary Christian issues. They provide straightforward, biblical critiques of some popular but unfortunate Christian trends, such as watered-down preaching and doctrinally questionable best-selling books. Dr. MacArthur ends with a practical plan for cultivating discernment in the Christian life.<br />
It is the duty of every Christian-not just pastors and elders-to follow the biblical command to cling to what is good and to reject what is not. This book will equip you with a foundation for biblical discernment that will enable you to make careful distinctions in your thinking about truth.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[The Power of Forgiveness ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[It can be said that unforgiveness is like drinking poison and expecting the one who wronged you to die. It may feel a lot easier to hold a grudge than it is to forgive someone who has wronged you, but in the long run, you will be robbed of joy, peace, and likely much more. Let&#8217;s talk today about the process of forgiveness and the power it has in our lives!<br />
Scripture &#8211; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+4">Ephesians 4</a><br />
<br />
<a href="http://amzn.to/2gGhGQ1">Search for Significance</a> &#8211; Robert McGee&#8217;s best-selling book has helped millions of readers learn how to be free to enjoy Christ&#8217;s love while no longer basing their self-worth on their accomplishments or the opinions of others. In fact, Billy Graham said that it was a book that &#8220;should be read by every Christian.&#8221;<br />
In this re-launch of this timeless classic you will:<br />
Gain new skills for getting off the performance treadmill<br /><br />
Discover how four false beliefs have negatively impacted your life<br /><br />
Learn how to overcome obstacles that prevent you from experiencing the truth that your self-worth is found only in the love, acceptance, and forgiveness of Christ<br />

			<title><![CDATA[Living in Freedom after Forgiveness ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[When we have been wounded, we often feel quite justified in harboring bitterness, anger, resentment, hurt and more.  Friends will tell us we are as well, but the Bible says something different, and we can only learn to live in freedom if we can obey what it says. Please don&#8217;t miss this opportunity to hear about what God has done in me as He&#8217;s challenged me to walk in forgiveness.<br />

Resources<br />
<a href="http://amzn.to/1K2GvKk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Gift of Forgiveness by Charles Stanley</a> &#8211; Charles Stanley, one of the most influential spiritual leaders of our day, shares the key to personal and even world peace in The Gift of Forgiveness. as Stanley points out that no sin is so shockingly evil it blocks God&#8217;s forgiveness nor so trivial it negates the need for God&#8217;s mercy, he shares the specifics of how to go about receiving and giving forgiveness.<br />
The Gift of Forgiveness reflects the heart of Stanley&#8217;s teaching ministry. In this markedly helpful book, Stanley addresses such questions as how to practice a life of forgiveness in all your relationships and how to make forgiveness an ongoing, practical experience in your life.<br />
<a href="http://amzn.to/1Ov9mgL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Forgiveness</a> by John MacArthur &#8211; &#8220;The greatest measuring rod of love in the life of a Christian may be forgiveness, because God showed His love to us in terms of forgiveness.&#8221; ?John MacArthur<br />
Does anyone really want to forgive? Or admit that we need forgiveness? Whether we&#8217;re giving or receiving, forgiveness is hard. It seems unfair. It feels unnatural. And as best-selling author and pastor John MacArthur demonstrates, forgiveness apart from Christ is unnatural. It is only as we understand our need, Christ&#8217;s power and example, and what it reallly means to love that we can embrace two of the most liberating acts of love: forgiving and being forgiven.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[Finding Teachable Moments – Ruth Simons]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Ruth Chou Simons is an artist, writer, entrepreneur, and speaker. She is the creator of the GraceLaced online art shoppe, blog, and the popular Instagram community where she shares scriptural truths daily through honest words and her hand-painted artwork. Ruth and her husband, Troy, live in New Mexico and are grateful parents to six sons—their greatest adventure.<br /><br />
Find more of Ruth’s heart and art at <a href="http://Gracelaced.com">GraceLaced.com</a> and @gracelaced on Instagram,<br /><br />
Facebook, and Twitter.<br />
Ruth&#8217;s new book <a href="http://amzn.to/2ws0Kqy">Gracelaced</a>  is about more than pretty florals and fanciful brushwork—it&#8217;s about flourishing. With carefully crafted intention, this beautiful volume of 32 seasonal devotions from artist and author Ruth Chou Simons encourages readers in any circumstance to become deeply rooted in God&#8217;s faithful promises. GraceLaced extends a soul-stirring invitation to draw close to God while&#8230;<br /><br />
resting in who He is<br /><br />
rehearsing the truth He says about you<br /><br />
responding in faith to those truths<br /><br />
remembering His provision to sustain you, time and time again<br /><br />
More than 800 individual pieces of art came together in the crafting of this book, including dozens of new, hand-painted Scripture vignettes that Ruth is known for.<br />
Who we are and who God is never changes, even though everything else rarely stays the same. Let this book point you to truth as you journey through the changing seasons of your heart.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[From the Archives: The Greatest of these is Love: A Conversation About Transgenderism and Our Role as Believers]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today on the podcast, I&#8217;m replying to a question I am getting a lot lately: &#8220;How do we respond to the cultural push to normalize gender fluidity?&#8221;<br />
This is an important topic, but we can&#8217;t talk about transgender issues—or any other issue—without first remembering that God calls us to speak the truth in love. God loves us, no matter our struggles. Surely His heart breaks over the sin that is causing people to do irreparable harm to their bodies in the name of finding their own version of truth.<br />
We are a culture in crisis.<br /><br />
Somehow we’ve come to a place where women who do not want men in their bathrooms and locker rooms are accused of bigotry and labeled &#8220;transphobic.&#8221; It&#8217;s an upside-down world and it&#8217;s requiring that we have a tough conversation. Listen in as we talk about this very important topic.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[From the Archives – Sacred Responsibility: Why Christian Parents Need to Talk with Their Kids About Transgenderism]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[We&#8217;re replaying a series from the archives today and Friday. Did you know that as a Christian, you are an &#8220;ambassador&#8221; for Christ? God says you are making His appeal through the way you live your life! God’s Word provides guidance for Christians trying to make sense of the transgender moment.When it comes to transgenderism, the Bible actually has a lot to say—not by a prooftext here or there but by a rich and pervasive understanding of gender and sexual identity. (<a href="https://blogs.thegospelcoalition.org/kevindeyoung/2016/09/08/what-does-the-bible-say-about-transgenderism/">See TGC article</a>)<br />
Obviously, transgenderism, as a cultural trend, is incredibly complex, touching on fields as disparate as genetics, fashion, medicine, law, education, entertainment, athletics, and religious liberty. We need Christians thinking through, and talking to, all of these issues.<br />
Listen in as Heidi tackles this very important topic and reminds us that LOVE, not culture is defines the behavior of God&#8217;s people.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[How to Talk So Your Kids Will Hear You – Rebecca Lindenbach – Part 2]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<br />
Teen rebellion is seen as a cultural norm, but Rebecca Gregoire Lindenbach begs to differ. In Why I Didn’t Rebel&#8211;based on a viral blog post that has been read by more than 750,000 people&#8211;Lindenbach shows how rebellion is neither unavoidable nor completely understood.  You&#8217;ll love hearing her point of view in this two part series!<br />
Rather than provide step-by-step instructions on how to construct the perfect family, Lindenbach tells her own story and the stories of others as examples of what went right, inviting readers to think differently about parenting. Addressing hot-button issues such as courtship, the purity movement, and spanking&#8211;and revealing how some widely&#8211;held beliefs in the Christian community may not actually help children&#8211;Why I Didn’t Rebel provides an utterly unique, eye-opening vision for raising kids who follow God rather than the world.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://lifeasadare.com">Rebecca Gregoire Lindenbach</a> is an author, blogger, and psychology graduate from Ottawa, Canada. The daughter of blogger and author Sheila Wray Gregoire, Lindenbach is an online entrepreneur passionate about challenging pat answers and daring people to live beyond the status quo. She just celebrated her second anniversary this July. Together they have a curmudgeonly old-man Yorkshire Terrier named Winston.

			<title><![CDATA[Whose Kids Are They, Anyway?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Last week in a bold, anti-parent move, the school board of Northern California’s Rocklin Academy Gateway voted unanimously to keep <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article174072431.html">a policy</a> that allows books that promote transgenderism to be read to children as young as five, but added a policy that they would warn parents before they did.<br />
Despite notifying the parents, however, the school board denied a proposal to give parents the right to pull their children out of classes that would teach the children pro-transgender education, essentially making the notification rule useless.  (Article from <a href="https://www.redstate.com/brandon_morse/2017/09/20/california-school-board-approves-transgender-books-kindergartners-disallows-parents-remove-children-class/">Red State</a>)<br />
Many people assert that there is nothing parents can do—or that they don&#8217;t care what their children are being taught. I disagree on both counts. Listen in!<br />

			<title><![CDATA[The Source of Wisdom ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[There is only one source of true wisdom, and knowing it will change your life. The only way to be a MomStrong Mom is to know the root of true wisdom! We&#8217;re talking about that pure and gentle wisdom today as we seek to teach and love our families.<br />
Scriptures<br />
James 3:13-18<br />

<a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog//?p=24500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three Traits of a Wise Believer</a> &#8211; The Bible tells us that there is absolute truth and that it is not relative.  Walking that out in faith in our culture today requires much wisdom, but thankfully we know the One who gives generously!  Listen in today as we talk about three traits of a wise believer.<br />
<a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog//?p=625" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Knowledge vs. Wisdom</a> (blog post) &#8211; As parents, we should be interested in teaching wisdom first, because knowledge without wisdom leads to pride.  And pride leads to ruin.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[Miracles for Bobby, The Story From Bobby’s Mom ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today, I have a very special guest on the podcast: my sister. Listen in as Heather tells the story of my nephew Bobby&#8217;s near-fatal car accident in June 2017 and his miraculous road to healing in the aftermath of a devastating brain and spinal injury.<br />
You&#8217;ll notice the sound quality is a little rough &#8211; because we recorded this in the hospital &#8211; and you may notice it&#8217;s a little longer than usual, because, well&#8230; we had a window and we took it. I hope you&#8217;ll be encouraged as you listen to our story of tears, triumph and testimony as we take listeners back to that terrible night and bear witness to the many miracles we have seen in the aftermath of tragedy. The takeaway? God can be trusted.<br />
We serve a God of miracles!<br />

			<title><![CDATA[Why Motherhood Matters, with September McCarthy – Part 2 ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[I have my friend, September McCarthy, joining me for a couple days and today we&#8217;re talking about Biblical communication within your home. Hmmm&#8230; we could use that! Listen in and be encouraged. <br />
September McCarthy is a writer, speaker, popular blogger, wife, and a home-educating mother to ten beautiful children. She is juggling the stages of motherhood, from adult children to toddlers, and is now a grandma to two more blessings.<br />
September writes with a heart of compassion for broken lives and shares hope in her words for women in every season of life.<br />
She is the founder and director of <a href="http://www.raisinggenerationstoday.com/">Raising Generations Today</a>, a nonprofit ministry designed to equip and inspire moms to reach the hearts of their children for God’s glory.<br />
September also blogs regularly at <a href="http://www.septembermccarthy.com">One September Day</a> where she encourages women to be brave and to embrace the gifts that God has placed upon them to hand the torch of the Gospel to their family and those around them.<br />
<a href="http://heidistjohn.com/scripturewriting"></a><br />
<a href="http://amzn.to/2vjqiBb">Why Motherhood Matters</a> &#8211; Do you ever wonder if your efforts as a mom make any difference?<br />
Take heart. Whether you&#8217;re struggling through sleepless nights with your toddler or endless battles with your teen, September McCarthy&#8217;s story offers practical insights and powerful inspiration to encourage you on your own mothering journey.<br />
As a mom for 25 years who continues to raise young children and love her young adults, September imparts words of wisdom and grace in key areas of Christian parenting, including&#8230;<br />
faith—getting honest with your family about your need for Jesus<br /><br />
wellness—learning to take care of your kids&#8230;and yourself<br /><br />
education—raising a new generation with creativity and character<br /><br />
relationships—speaking to the heart of your children in unique ways<br /><br />
In these pages you&#8217;ll find sweet anecdotes and gentle guidance for those moments you need both a breather and a lifeline. Motherhood is an incredible labor of love—and in the scope of eternity, it matters more than you know.<br />

			<description><![CDATA[Erin Odom, the founder of The Humbled Homemaker Homemaker, is joining me on the podcast today! We&#8217;re talking through her journey through financial hardship, and the freedom they found there. Listen in and be encouraged!<br />
<a href="http://morethanjustmakingit.com/">Erin Odom</a> is the founder of <a href="https://thehumbledhomemaker.com/">The Humbled Homemaker</a>, a blog dedicated to grace-filled living designed to equip and encourage mothers in the trenches. Her Southern charm and wealth of inspirational, practical content has drawn an audience of millions over the years. Erin and her husband, Will, live in the South where they raise their four children.<br />

<br />
<a href="http://amzn.to/2vYmPK0">More Than Just Making It</a>  &#8211; When you&#8217;re trapped in a cycle of financial frustration, and you feel like you&#8217;ve tried everything only to end up with more month than money yet again, More Than Just Making It is your promise and pathway to thriving again.<br />
Take it from someone who&#8217;s been there. Erin Odom grew up in the private schools and neatly manicured lawns of Upper Middle Class America, but was thrown into low-income living during the economic crash. She was a stay-at-home-mom, her husband was supporting the family on a teacher&#8217;s salary, and despite the fact that they had no debt to their name, they were scrambling to make ends meet. Suddenly Erin found herself standing in line for food stamps, turning down play dates because she couldn&#8217;t afford the gas, and ultimately walking into bankruptcy court in the eighth month of her third pregnancy.<br />
More Than Just Making It tells the story of their breaking point, as well as the triumph of their comeback. It took hard work, creativity, and faith in God’s provision to reset their bank account as well as their hearts, but ultimately they found a new way to thrive and freedom from financial anxiety. You can do the same. Learn how Erin and her family saved enough money to put $30,000 down on a home, buy a minivan in cash, and begin sending their daughter to private Christian school. More Than Just Making It will encourage readers to rise above their circumstances, empower them with money-saving tips, and reimagine the good life as God designed it outside the myth of the American Dream.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[The Snare of Offense]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[The standard by which we measure offense as Christians needs to be re-calibrated, and fast.  We have lost our way, men and women of God! We have made an idol out of our right not to be offended.  Listen. Offense is a trap; a snare set by the devil to distract us from what really matters, and boy are we stepping on almost every trap the devil is setting right now. Listen in as I talk about an alternative.  It&#8217;s worth it!<br />

			<title><![CDATA[Gospel Centered Mom – Part 2 ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[You long to be the mom your kids need, but often you’re convinced you come up short. The label “not enough” seems to be stamped across everything you do—and yet parenting is the one thing you want most to get right. What if the solution is simply to embrace the truth that you are not enough—but God is?<br /><br />
In Gospel-Centered Mom Brooke McGlothlin reveals how our entire approach to motherhood shifts when we stop chasing our vision of a perfect family and start full-out pursuing God.<br />
Brooke McGlothlin is co-founder and President of <a href="http://www.themobsociety.com/">The MOB Society</a>, author of <a href="http://amzn.to/2hAVkCH">Praying for Boys: Asking God for the Things They Need Most</a>, co-author of <a href="http://amzn.to/2fl3n5X">Hope for the Weary Mom: Let God Meet You in the Mess</a>, and the <a href="http://amzn.to/2wl20Is">Hope for the Weary Mom 40 Day Devotional</a>. She’s also creator of the Fight Like a BoyMom Program, and a mother of two boys who believes God has chosen her to fight for the hearts of her sons. Her newest book, <a href="http://amzn.to/2ugD1bY">Gospel Centered Mom</a>, has just released. Brooke can be found most often with her nose in a book, or cheering like a mad woman as her baseball boys take the field.<br />

			<description><![CDATA[Your job as a mom is to encourage your kids to follow in Jesus&#8217; footsteps. You (and all other Christians) will let your kids down, so they need to know that Christ is the one they should be depending on. It pleases God when we focus not only on ourselves in the battle, but on the One who has won the battle. You will be blessed as you have the opportunity to lead others around you to follow Jesus!<br />

			<description><![CDATA[<br />
Have you ever been so angry with your kids that you turned into &#8220;that&#8221; mom? Me too. It&#8217;s funny how the sweet children we love from morning until night can also be the ones who see the worst in us.<br />

<a href="http://amzn.to/2w342Nu"></a>Do you believe your struggle with anger stems from the wrong behavior you see displayed in your children? The knee-jerk reactions and blow-ups you’re facing are often a result of a bigger set of “triggers.” Some of these are external, like a child’s disobedience, backtalk, or selective hearing, while others are internal, like an overflowing schedule, sleep-deprivation, or perhaps your own painful experiences from childhood. Triggers: Exchanging Parent’s Angry Reactions for Gentle Biblical Responses examines common parenting issues that cause us to explode inappropriately at our children.<br />

<a href="http://www.firmlyplantedfamily.org/pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firmly Planted Family Bible Study</a><br />
We all agree that teaching our children the life-changing truths of the Bible is one of our most important jobs as parents. But where do we begin? How do we consistently explore God’s Word in a way that helps our children understand and apply the core truths of biblical teaching in their own lives? The Firmly Planted Family Series is divided into ten-week studies and is your key to making sense of the Bible—even if you’re learning right along with your children. Each lesson provides a core idea, a simple narrative, memory verses and discussion questions for children of all ages. And the companion student workbook is filled with age-appropriate, full-color, reproducible activities for children of any age!<br />

In an age of open-mindedness, many believers accept too much with too little discernment, resulting in great confusion and compromise. But God&#8217;s Word makes it clear that not everything that glitters is gold. False teaching is at every turn, and the temptation to embrace it is great. As God&#8217;s people we are called to sift through the overwhelming number of traditions and trends and use the truth of Scripture to determine which are the true treasures-and which are &#8220;fool&#8217;s gold.&#8221;<br />
General editor John MacArthur and the contributors of this uncompromising book define the principles of biblical discernment and use them to address several contemporary Christian issues.

Here&#8217;s the thing: If we don&#8217;t set a place for the truth of Scripture at the table of our children&#8217;s hearts, the world will set out a feast all it&#8217;s own.<br />
<a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog//?p=22771" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What Are We Like When No One Else is Watching?</a> -Are we growing in our walk with God? Today, we&#8217;re talking about a &#8220;big&#8221; word &#8230; sanctification. It&#8217;s a big word that means a simple thing: grow.  Grow. As Christians, we&#8217;re called to live set apart lives—no matter who&#8217;s watching.<br />

<a href="http://www.firmlyplantedfamily.org/pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firmly Planted Family Bible Study</a><br />
We all agree that teaching our children the life-changing truths of the Bible is one of our most important jobs as parents. But where do we begin? How do we consistently explore God’s Word in a way that helps our children understand and apply the core truths of biblical teaching in their own lives? The Firmly Planted Family Series is divided into ten-week studies and is your key to making sense of the Bible—even if you’re learning right along with your children. Each lesson provides a core idea, a simple narrative, memory verses and discussion questions for children of all ages. And the companion student workbook is filled with age-appropriate, full-color, reproducible activities for children of any age!<br />
<a title="Age of Opportunity" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0875526055/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0875526055&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thbumo0c-20&amp;linkId=X4KNNSWSWNZFN7ZI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Age of Opportunity</a> by Paul Tripp<br /><br />
Are you hoping to merely survive your teenagers? With compassion, wit, and wisdom, Tripp uncovers the heart issues affecting families during the often-chaotic adolescent years.<br />
<a title="Fools Gold" href="http://amzn.to/1IOW9yW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fool&#8217;s Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error</a> edited by Dr. John MacArthur<br />
In an age of open-mindedness, many believers accept too much with too little discernment, resulting in great confusion and compromise. But God&#8217;s Word makes it clear that not everything that glitters is gold. False teaching is at every turn, and the temptation to embrace it is great. As God&#8217;s people we are called to sift through the overwhelming number of traditions and trends and use the truth of Scripture to determine which are the true treasures-and which are &#8220;fool&#8217;s gold.&#8221;<br />
General editor John MacArthur and the contributors of this uncompromising book define the principles of biblical discernment and use them to address several contemporary Christian issues. They provide straightforward, biblical critiques of some popular but unfortunate Christian trends, such as watered-down preaching and doctrinally questionable best-selling books. Dr. MacArthur ends with a practical plan for cultivating discernment in the Christian life.<br />
It is the duty of every Christian-not just pastors and elders-to follow the biblical command to cling to what is good and to reject what is not.

*New friend alert!* I know you&#8217;re going to love Jessica and her heart for moms&#8230; but that&#8217;s just the beginning of what God is doing through this sweet mama! Soon after Jessica Kastner became a mother, she wondered if she was the only mom who found pretend play more boring than watching playdough harden and who dreaded yet another friend’s Instagram post of homemade deliciousness. Jessica shares her experience as an “unmom”—a mom who loves her kids more than she loves the daily experience of mothering. She helps readers laugh at the ridiculous, delight in the unpredictable, and enjoy being the mothers God made them to be.<br /><br />
Jessica Kastner is an award-winning journalist and a contributor for the Christian Broadcasting Network’s CBN.com, Beliefnet.com, and the Huffington Post’s Christianity blog. As Connecticut’s coordinator for Straight Ahead Ministries, she shares God’s message of hope by leading Bible studies in juvenile detention centers. When she’s not on the trampoline with her three boys in Connecticut, Jessica shares her unapologetically “real” commentary on the Christian life at <a href="http://www.JessicaKastner.com">www.JessicaKastner.com</a>.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[There is Power in Prayer ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[What does it look like to be a disciple of Jesus? Step ONE: trust the Lord in every circumstance. Join me today as I talk about what&#8217;s happening with Bobby and what it means today, &#8220;Thy Will Be Done.&#8221; When we pray, we pray believing God hears, and understands&#8230; but more than that, we trust God&#8217;s heart in the process.  Listen in!<br /><br />

<a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog//?p=13137">Teach me to Pray</a> &#8211; A podcast and short post where Heidi St. John reminds us that God wants to talk to us in prayer. It&#8217;s vital to live a thriving, grounded and humble life.<br />
The Power of Prayer &#8211; <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/?p=22863">Podcast 1</a> &amp; <a href="http://heidistjohn.com/blog/?p=24994">Podcast 2</a><br />

<a href="http://amzn.to/1EPRrds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Praying Life</a> &#8211; Author Paul Miller shares his insights and conclusions about how to connect the broken pieces of your life and allow prayer—even poorly delivered—to fill the gaps with meaning and substance.  Miller&#8217;s down-to-earth approach and practical nature will help you see that your relationship with God can grow and your communication with Him can get better.  Parents will find Miller&#8217;s family-life experiences especially helpful.<br />
<a href="http://amzn.to/1hUKtip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lord, Teach Us To Pray</a> &#8211;<br />
Since this book was published over a century ago, countless readers have learned through its pages that no one can teach prayer better than Jesus Christ himself. This enduring classic will transform your prayers and life as you open your heart to the prayer-lessons Jesus gave.<br /><br />
&#8220;The Father waits to hear every prayer of faith. He wants to give us whatever we ask for in Jesus&#8217; name. If there is one thing I think the Church needs to learn, it is that God intends prayer to have an answer, and that we have not yet fully conceived of what God will do for us if we believe that our prayers will be heard. God hears prayer.&#8221;<br />

			<description><![CDATA[UPDATE: Since I recorded this&#8230; in the last few hours, we have seen that God is bringing Bobby back to us. He is moving, responding and even moving his arm on command! God is able!!!<br />
As we continue to walk this road through tragedy after my nephew&#8217;s recent accident, I&#8217;m learning how much I love the body of Christ.  We&#8217;ve never had suffering quite like this in our family, and while we pray and wait for Bobby&#8217;s healing, we&#8217;re continuing to be reminded of what really matters. We trust as believers in the goodness of God, and we know that He is working even now.<br />
Romans 8:28<br />
El Roi &#8211; the God who sees<br />
El Raphah &#8211; the God who heals<br />
Psalm 147:3<br />

Samuel and Rebecca Rainey, preteens themselves not many years ago, add their perspective as young adults who vividly recall their own successes and failures as teenagers.

<a href="http://amzn.to/2s8lS2p">Kisses from Katie &#8211; Katie Davis</a> &#8211; The New York Times bestselling account of a courageous eighteen-year-old from Nashville who gave up every comfort and convenience to become the adoptive mother to thirteen girls in Uganda.<br /><br />
What would cause an eighteen-year-old senior class president and homecoming queen from Nashville, Tennessee, to disobey and disappoint her parents by forgoing college, break her little brother’s heart, lose all but a handful of her friends (because they think she has gone off the deep end), and break up with the love of her life, all so she could move to Uganda, where she knew only one person and didn’t even speak the language?<br /><br />
A passion to follow Jesus. <br /><br />
Katie Davis left over Christmas break of her senior year for a short mission trip to Uganda and her life was turned completely inside out. She found herself so moved by the people of Uganda and the needs she saw that she knew her calling was to return and care for them. Katie, a charismatic and articulate young woman, is in the process of adopting thirteen children in Uganda and has established a ministry, Amazima, that feeds and sends hundreds more to school while teaching them the Word of Jesus Christ.<br />

Elyse Fitzpatrick, coauthor of Women Helping Women (a Gold Medallion Finalist), offers practical advice for conquering the paralyzing emotions many women encounter as they battle difficult, often overwhelming concerns about rebellious children, problems in the workplace or home, health issues, financial difficulties, and more.<br />
In the Bible, God gives guidance and offers the true solution to our anxieties and fears. Overcoming Fear, Worry, and Anxiety accesses this information to help women&#8211;<br />
<br />
* Identify the source of fear, worry, and anxiety<br />
* Transform fearful thoughts into peaceful confidence<br />
* Discover specific strategies for overcoming anxiety<br />
<br />
Women will find comfort and encouragement through real-life examples of how others, including Elyse, cast their cares upon God and experience His strength and love.<br />
<a title="What Women Fear" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805464298/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0805464298&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thbumo0c-20&amp;linkId=SRLW554FXFKZY4SC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What Women Fear: Walking in a Faith that Transforms</a> by Angie Smith<br />
In What Women Fear, acclaimed writer and speaker Angie Smith admits, &#8220;fear is a major part of my testimony&#8221; and talks openly about her treatment for anxiety as a child. Giving a voice to the problem, she says, &#8220;I truly believe every single one of us struggles with some type of fear, whether it&#8217;s fear of flying or fear of being &#8216;found out.&#8217; Maybe you don’t worry about dying, but you get sick thinking about the fact that you might fail.&#8221;<br />
<a title="Fear: Breaking Its Grip" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1596381213/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1596381213&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thbumo0c-20&amp;linkId=DUVHYD5NZ3DLAPVX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fear: Breaking Its Grip</a> &#8211; by Lou Priolo<br />
Do you feel paralyzed by fear? Does it keep you from doing what you know is right and from being who you want to be? When fear takes over, it seems like a controlling, irresistible force and often becomes an excuse for not doing what we should.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[The Greatest of these is Love: A Conversation About Transgenderism and Our Role as Believers]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today on the podcast, I&#8217;m replying to a question I am getting a lot lately: &#8220;How do we respond to the cultural push to normalize gender fluidity?&#8221;<br />
This is an important topic, but we can&#8217;t talk about transgender issues—or any other issue—without first remembering that God calls us to speak the truth in love. God loves us, no matter our struggles. Surely His heart breaks over the sin that is causing people to do irreparable harm to their bodies in the name of finding their own version of truth.<br />
We are a culture in crisis.<br /><br />
Somehow we’ve come to a place where women who do not want men in their bathrooms and locker rooms are accused of bigotry and labeled &#8220;transphobic.&#8221; It&#8217;s an upside-down world and it&#8217;s requiring that we have a tough conversation. Listen in as we talk about this very important topic.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[Sacred Responsibility: Why Christian Parents Need to Talk with Their Kids About Transgenderism ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Did you know that as a Christian, you are an &#8220;ambassador&#8221; for Christ? God says you are making His appeal through the way you live your life! God’s Word provides guidance for Christians trying to make sense of the transgender moment.When it comes to transgenderism, the Bible actually has a lot to say—not by a prooftext here or there but by a rich and pervasive understanding of gender and sexual identity. (<a href="https://blogs.thegospelcoalition.org/kevindeyoung/2016/09/08/what-does-the-bible-say-about-transgenderism/">See TGC article</a>)<br />
Obviously, transgenderism, as a cultural trend, is incredibly complex, touching on fields as disparate as genetics, fashion, medicine, law, education, entertainment, athletics, and religious liberty. We need Christians thinking through, and talking to, all of these issues.<br />
Listen in as Heidi tackles this very important topic and reminds us that LOVE, not culture is defines the behavior of God&#8217;s people.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[Biblical Womanhood – Part 3/3 ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Have you noticed that womanhood, even the heart of femininity is under attack in the culture today?<br />
<br />
This week, Heidi is talking honestly about God&#8217;s heart for women—and how being created &#8220;out&#8221; of man brings with it a special calling and a special kind of strength. God created woman to be a helper. &#8220;Helper&#8221; is a word that demands explanation today&#8230;  and so we&#8217;re going to talk about it! &#8220;Helper&#8221; is not a term that indicates a lesser status, or the type of help that assists in an unimportant way. Listen in and be encouraged, busy moms! You are loved, and your role is of unimaginable importance in the eyes of God.<br />

			<itunes:summary>Have you noticed that womanhood, even the heart of femininity is under attack in the culture today?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This week, Heidi is talking honestly about God&amp;#8217;s heart for women—and how being created &amp;#8220;out&amp;#8221; of man brings with it a special calling and a special kind of strength. God created woman to be a helper. &amp;#8220;Helper&amp;#8221; is a word that demands explanation today&amp;#8230;  and so we&amp;#8217;re going to talk about it! &amp;#8220;Helper&amp;#8221; is not a term that indicates a lesser status, or the type of help that assists in an unimportant way. Listen in and be encouraged, busy moms! You are loved, and your role is of unimaginable importance in the eyes of God.&lt;br /&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[A child’s first lessons about their bodies—everything from their appearance to what God says about human sexuality—come from their parents. The messages we give them early in life have a deep, long-lasting impact on how they will see themselves as adults.<br />
<br />
So where do we start? How do we pass on a godly perspective of sexuality and beauty to our kids? As in every other area of life, we start at the starting place: the Bible. We dare not trust human wisdom where these tender topics are concerned.

			<title><![CDATA[Dear Church, Jesus Makes You Relevant ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[The modern church is facing a crisis of belief. Do we really believe that the message of the Gospel is enough? Do we really believe that God is big enough to push through the cultural fog and invade the hearts of men and women today? What good is an entertaining church service that fails to entertain the questions that this generation is asking? What good is it if we can’t articulate compassion and truth in a way that clearly addresses the message of the cross? The cross is hope.<br />
…and hope does not disappoint. Hope has a name. It’s Jesus.<br />
<br />
The truth of the gospel has not changed. The saving power of a relationship with Jesus is all the relevance we need.

Writing the Scriptures and learning to personalize them as an example of how to pray is an excellent tool. You're not alone if you struggle to find the words to pray, but we see many people in the Bible who have gone before us and show us examples, so we don't have to stay confused.

			<title><![CDATA[Part 3 of 3: LOVING and Keeping it Real: A Transparent Discussion of Race Between Friends]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Join me for Part 3 in this series! <br />
Tensions are running high in our nation and in our world right now. Last week on Instagram, I mentioned that I was praying for a peaceful transition of power between Adminstrations, and my new friend, Aaron Young, commented that we needed to do a better job actually talking with each other—black and white—so that we can have a better understanding of where each of us is coming from. I couldn't agree more, and so, I invited two friends of color on the show with me this week.<br />
<br />
It's hard at times, but listening to each other is good. I hope you'll be blessed as Aaron, Dr. Lainna Callentine and myself talk openly and honestly about race, the culture, and what we have in common. Be encouraged! We are brothers and sisters in Christ!

			<description><![CDATA[Three days after the US elections and Americans are asking, "Where do we go from here?" The answer, according to God, is to humbly seek Him in prayer.  This is our challenge. To be like Elisha. David. Paul.  To pray for healing and revival. Prayer is our most effective and powerful weapon in the battles we are facing as a nation.<br />
<br />
If we're going to see our nation prosper again, we must return to God.  The Church needs to be on its knees in prayer.

			<title><![CDATA[A Hope That Does Not Disappoint]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[There is a lot of fear in the United States and around the world right now, but did you know that there is an emotion that is more powerful than fear? There is—it's called HOPE.<br />
<br />
Hope is a powerful motivator!<br />
<br />
As Christians, we dare not put our hope in an election. That doesn't mean we sit it out—it means that we cast our vote with hope.<br />
<br />
Hope changes everything. Once we have been obedient, once we have made our stand, when we have done what we could do—when we have prayed, obeyed and trusted—we wait. With hope.<br />
<br />
No matter what happens on November 8th, our hope is in Him.

			<title><![CDATA[America’s Moment of Truth]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[America is at fork in the road. If Hillary Clinton is elected, we will be well on our way toward a socialist, globalist nation whose tax payers fund the murder of their own unborn citizens.<br />
<br />
Join Heidi St. John as she talks about the very real struggle that the Christian community has had with what to do in the 2016 election. It comes down to justice vs witness—so I ask you—where will our Christian "witness" be if we stand aside and allow the our tax dollars to fund the brutal murder of the unborn? Do we really think God would nod tacitly at His children as they let it happen in the name of Christ?<br />
<br />
Our moral indignation at what Trump said eleven years ago will pale in comparison to what Hillary Clinton will do if she is elected to the highest office in the land.<br />
<br />
We need to recognize what is really at stake in this election.<br />

			<title><![CDATA[The Angry Child: Encouragement to Go the Distance]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[We live in an awfully angry society, and our children are noticing.  Not surprisingly, the Bible has quite a bit to say about a heart of anger as well, and it's time we stop and notice.  It matters that we check our own hearts, and it matters how we handle it when we see it in our children.

			<description><![CDATA[There are many issues in our culture today that can be argued or explained with emotional reasoning, but our emotions often don't lead us in a Biblical direction.  It's critical that we know how to discern right and wrong through a Biblical lens, so we can pass that discernment on to our children as we nurture them in the ways of the Lord.  Join me for week 3/4 in our podcast-led Bible Study as we search the Scripture for practical ways to do this.

			<description><![CDATA[Have you been tempted to place your hope in a person?  You're not alone—but Psalm 62 tells us that our hope should rest in God alone. Our hope as a nation will never be found in a president, in a curriculum, in a pastor or even a parent.  Our hope should rest in God and in His Word. This view will not make you popular—but it will bring your peace.  Take heart! God has overcome the world!

			<title><![CDATA[“I Want it All” – Meet Gwen Smith!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA["Gwen Smith knows how easy it is to dismiss God’s plans with the thoughts, I can’t make a big difference for God because I’m just an ordinary woman with an ordinary life. Yet God created us to join Him in doing amazing work in the world. He created us to live with abundant joy, courage, and influence. But not the joy, courage, and influence of the world. He offers His grace for each failure, His love that shatters hate, His peace that soothes the turmoil, His comfort, guidance, wisdom, rest, power, and significance. Every blessing He has for us is ours for the taking."

Satan's goal is to distract moms from what really matters—the bringing up of our children. While the world will tell you to mother your kids from your own strength—God has another way! He wants to replace your weakness with His strength in a beautiful exchange. Your job has never been more important than it is right now.  Listen in and be encouraged as Heidi talks about courageous mothering.

			<title><![CDATA[The Lord is My Strength]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Since surgery, I'm off my game. Can you relate? I have been struggling with staying on an exercise routine these past few weeks. I’ve had a few things in life that knocked me off the exercise wagon and I’ve had a really hard time trying to get back on it. Psalm 18:1 says, “I love You Lord, my strength.”<br />
<br />
This is a very long Psalm, but I just want to share a few things that have jumped out to me.<br />
<br />
“I call to the Lord who is worthy of praise and I was saved from my enemies. The chords of death have entangled me, the torn of destruction overwhelm me; the chords of the grave coiled around me; the snares of death in front of me; in my distress, I call to the Lord. I cry to my God for help.”<br />
<br />
If you look down further, it says, “To the faithful, You’ve shown Yourself faithful.” And then in verse 32, “It is God who arms me with strength, and keeps my ways secure. He makes my feet like the feet of a deer. He causes me to stand on the heights; He trains my body for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.”<br />
<br />
I don’t know about you, but even when I know that I struggle with the things I want to do, (like exercise) I and I might have to drag myself to do it, but there is this wonderful feeling of accomplishment on the other side of exercise. I  just need to force myself to get there.<br />
<br />
If you’re feeling that way today, I  want to encourage you

			<title><![CDATA[Chores and Children]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Are you training your kids to help around the house? Several months ago, I put a chore-chart from my friend Toni (The Happy Housewife) on Facebook at The Busy Mom and went about my day.  I forgot about it, actually.  I thought that moms would love this handy chart, and that people would think, “Yes! Chores for children!”<br />
<br />
Boy was I wrong.<br />
<br />
I was amazed at how much controversy this little chore-chart generated. Before the end of the day I was called "abusive" and "lazy" for requiring my children to be active participants in our home. And we don't even live on a farm!  My children are working inside our house doing the things that people who live in houses do: they are cleaning, cooking, tidying.. and yes, they're playing too.

			<title><![CDATA[A Sit-Down Affair]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[We live in a culture that has largely forgotten the power of a shared meal. There is something missing when we rush a busy day to the next. We think we are saving time when we rush through the drive through again, but really we aren’t saving anything. Days turn to weeks, weeks turn to months, and months turn into years. Where we spend our time is a window into our hearts. It is an indicator of where our treasure is. In Matthew 6:21, we read, “For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.”
